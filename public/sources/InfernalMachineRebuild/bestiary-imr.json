His career began as a priest in the service of Moloch, where he rose through the ranks before eventually taking over the temple as a working laboratory. Most of his experiments have involved the pursuit of new forms of life, resulting in such creatures as the thessalhydra and the owlbear. In recent years, he has also researched the prolonging of life\u2014namely his own. Thessalar hopes that by becoming a lich, his research and experiments can continue indefinitely.\nOver time, Thessalar has subjected himself to so many of his own experiments that his blood has taken on alchemical and magical properties.
