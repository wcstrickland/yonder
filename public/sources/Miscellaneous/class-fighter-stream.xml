        <text>At 3rd level, your tactical acumen allows you to study an area of a battlefield and provide direction to your allies that can tilt a battle in your favor.</text>
        <text>As a bonus action or as part of the attack action, you can select an area on the ground that measures 10 feet on each side. This area is your tactical focus. It remains your tactical focus until you use this ability again or you are unable to take actions.</text>
        <text>When you select an area as your tactical focus, you choose one of your tactics to apply to that area. You gain three tactics at 3rd level. You gain an additional tactic at 7th and 15 level. Each time you complete a long rest, you can swap one of your tactics for a different one.</text>

        <text>Starting at 3rd level, you can grant your allies useful tactical insights while they are in the area of your tactical focus.</text>
        <text>You gain a number of uses of insight based on your fighter level.</text>
        <text>As a bonus action or as a part of an attack action you grant insight to yourself or allies in your tactical focus. You grant this benefit to yourself and as many allies as you wish in your focus, but you cannot expend more uses than you currently have [or more than the maximum in the table below. A creature can receive more than one Tactician's Insight when you take this action.]</text>
        <text>A creature that gains your insight can use it in two ways. It can regain hit points immediately upon receiving it. Roll 2d10 and the creature regains that many hit points. If the creature would gain hit points that place it above its maximum, it gains the difference as temporary hit points.</text>
        <text>Alternatively, a creature can save the insight to use when it hits with an attack. It increases the attack's damage by 2d10.</text>
        <text>You regain expended uses of Tactician's Insight when you complete a long rest.</text>

[Changed during stream to "You and your allies can basically teleport into your focus. Movement on allies turn." Specifically, the movement is not made as a reactionâ€”your allies can use their movement on their turn(s) to move towards the focus, and gain bonuses to speed or other effects (for example, ignoring difficult terrain, or movement does not provoke opportunity attacks) to aid and incentivize this.

        <name>Warlord (Livestream): Vexing Maneuvers</name>
        <text>   With precise movements, you and your allies dash around the foes to leave them confused and unable to pick out their most dangerous targets.</text>
        <text>   Each enemy in your tactical focus that you can see must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, it cannot leave your tactical focus using its move until the end of your next turn. As part of this gambit you may take the attack action.</text>
