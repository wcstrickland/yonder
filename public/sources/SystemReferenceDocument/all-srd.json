The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the stone. If the stone can\u2019t hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.\n    While this stone orbits your head, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the stone is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.\n    Strength (Very Rare). Your Strength score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pale blue rhomboid orbits your head.\n    Sustenance (Rare).

If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions.\n    The creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature\n    reverts to its figurine form.

It has 24 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends in beast form costs 1 charge. While it has charges, you can use it as often as you wish. When it runs out of charges, it reverts to a figurine and can\u2019t be used again until 7 days have passed, when it regains all its charges.\n\u2022 The goat of travail becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. Once it has been used, it can\u2019t be used again until 30 days have passed.\n\u2022 The goat of terror becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. The goat can\u2019t attack, but you can remove its horns and use them as weapons. One horn becomes a +1 lance, and the other becomes a +2 longsword. Removing a horn requires an action, and the weapons disappear and the horns return when the goat reverts to figurine form. In addition, the goat radiates a 30-foot-radius aura of terror while you are riding it. Any creature hostile to you that starts its turn in the aura must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the goat for 1 minute, or until the goat reverts to figurine form. The frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it successfully saves against the effect, a creature is immune to the goat\u2019s aura for the next 24 hours. Once the figurine has been used, it can\u2019t be used again until 15 days have passed.\n    Marble Elephant (Rare). This marble statuette is about 4 inches high and long. It can become an elephant for up to 24 hours. Once it has been used, it can\u2019t be used again until 7 days have passed.\n    Obsidian Steed (Very Rare). This polished obsidian horse can become a nightmare for up to 24 hours. The nightmare fights only to defend itself. Once it has been used, it can\u2019t be used again until 5 days have passed.\n    If you have a good alignment, the figurine has a 10 percent chance each time you use it to ignore your orders, including a command to revert to figurine form. If you mount the nightmare while it is ignoring your orders, you and the nightmare are instantly transported to a random location on the plane of Hades, where the nightmare reverts to figurine form. Onyx Dog (Rare). This onyx statuette of a dog can become a mastiff for up to 6 hours. The mastiff has an Intelligence of 8 and can speak Common. It also has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet and can see invisible creatures and objects within that range. Once it has been used, it can\u2019t be used again until 7 days have passed.\n    Serpentine Owl (Rare). This serpentine statuette of an owl can become a giant owl for up to 8 hours.

Alternatively, you can create 10 foot by 20 foot panels that are only 3 inches thick.\n    If the wall cuts through a creature\u2019s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice).

On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.\n    The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can\u2019t occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall doesn\u2019t need to be vertical or rest on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.\n    If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on.\n    The wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the GM\u2019s discretion.\n    If you maintain your concentration on this spell for its whole duration, the wall becomes permanent and can\u2019t be dispelled.

If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.\n    The glyph is nearly invisible, requiring an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to find it.\n    You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, approaching within a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object that holds it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers are opening the object, approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing or reading the glyph.\n    You can further refine the trigger so the spell is activated only under certain circumstances or according to a creature\u2019s physical characteristics (such as height or weight), or physical kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect hags or shapechangers). You can also specify creatures that don\u2019t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.\n    When you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the options below for its effect. Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60 foot radius sphere with dim light for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends. Each creature in the sphere when the glyph activates is targeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the sphere for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.\n    Death. Each target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save.\n    Discord. Each target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target bickers and argues with other creatures for 1 minute. During this time, it is incapable of meaningful communication and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.\n    Fear. Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes frightened for 1 minute on a failed save. While frightened, the target drops whatever it is holding and must move at least 30 feet away from the glyph on each of its turns, if able.\n    Hopelessness. Each target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target is overwhelmed with despair for 1 minute. During this time, it can\u2019t attack or target any creature with harmful abilities, spells, or other magical effects.\n    Insanity. Each target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target is driven insane for 1 minute. An insane creature can\u2019t take actions, can\u2019t understand what other creatures say, can\u2019t read, and speaks only in gibberish. The GM controls its movement, which is erratic.\n    Pain. Each target must make a Constitution saving throw and becomes incapacitated with excruciating pain for 1 minute on a failed save.\n    Sleep. Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and falls unconscious for 10 minutes on a failed save. A creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake.\n    Stunning. Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes stunned for 1 minute on a failed save.",

If another creature that can see the wall moves to within 20 feet of it or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute.\n    The wall consists of seven layers, each with a different color. When a creature attempts to reach into or pass through the wall, it does so one layer at a time through all the wall\u2019s layers. As it passes or reaches through each layer, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or be affected by that layer\u2019s properties as described below.\n    The wall can be destroyed, also one layer at a time, in order from red to violet, by means specific to each layer. Once a layer is destroyed, it remains so for the duration of the spell. A rod of cancellation destroys a prismatic wall, but an antimagic field has no effect on it.\n    1. Red. The creature takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, nonmagical ranged attacks can\u2019t pass through the wall. The layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 cold damage to it.\n    2. Orange. The creature takes 10d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, magical ranged attacks can\u2019t pass through the wall. The layer is destroyed by a strong wind.\n    3. Yellow. The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 60 force damage to it.\n    4. Green. The creature takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A passwall spell, or another spell of equal or greater level that can open a portal on a solid surface, destroys this layer.\n    5. Blue. The creature takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 fire damage to it.\n    6. Indigo. On a failed save, the creature is restrained. It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures don\u2019t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the creature collects three of a kind.\n    While this layer is in place, spells can\u2019t be cast through the wall. The layer is destroyed by bright light shed by a daylight spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level.\n    7. Violet. On a failed save, the creature is blinded. It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of the GM\u2019s choosing and is no longer blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn\u2019t its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.)

Spells and other magical effects, such as magic missile and charm person, that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target.\n    Areas of Magic. The area of another spell or magical effect, such as fireball, can\u2019t extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a wall of fire are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.\n    Spells. Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.\n    Magic Items. The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a +1 longsword in the sphere functions as a nonmagical longsword.\n    A magic weapon\u2019s properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere.

Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel.

You can also set conditions for creatures that don\u2019t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.\n    When you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes or a spell glyph.\n    Explosive Runes.

You can choose from any of the following effects when you cast this spell. As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.\n    Flood. You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land.\n    If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20 foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave\u2019s path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.\n    The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.\n    Part Water. You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell\u2019s area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.\n    Redirect Flow. You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell\u2019s area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.\n    Whirlpool. This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC.\n    When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw.

On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn\u2019t caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so.\n    The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage; this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.",

The spell simply takes effect.\n    Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:\n\u2022 You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn\u2019t a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.\n\u2022 You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the greater restoration spell.\n\u2022 You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.\n\u2022 You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich\u2019s life drain attack.\n\u2022 You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an opponent\u2019s successful save, a foe\u2019s critical hit, or a friend\u2019s failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.\n    You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the GM as precisely as possible. The GM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item\u2019s current owner.\n    The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can\u2019t be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn\u2019t 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast wish ever again if you suffer this stress.",

That entity sends a celestial, an elemental, or a fiend loyal to it to aid you, making the creature appear in an unoccupied space within range. If you know a specific creature\u2019s name, you can speak that name when you cast this spell to request that creature, though you might get a different creature anyway (GM\u2019s choice).\n    When the creature appears, it is under no compulsion to behave in any particular way. You can ask the creature to perform a service in exchange for payment, but it isn\u2019t obliged to do so. The requested task could range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, or protect us during our foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain for its services.\n    Payment can take a variety of forms. A celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you.\n    As a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 gp per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1,000 gp per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 gp per day. The GM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature\u2019s ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.\n    After the creature completes the task, or when the agreed upon duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to you, if appropriate to the task and if possible. If you are unable to agree on a price for the creature\u2019s service, the creature immediately returns to its home plane.\n    A creature enlisted to join your group counts as a member of it, receiving a full share of experience points awarded.",

You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 \u00d7 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The GM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.\n    Similar Area. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that\u2019s visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard\u2019s laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.\n    Mishap. The spell\u2019s unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the GM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).",

Heavy chains, firmly rooted in the ground, hold the target in place. The target is restrained until the spell ends, and it can\u2019t move or be moved by any means until then.\n    The special component for this version of the spell is a fine chain of precious metal.\n    Hedged Prison. The spell transports the target into a tiny demiplane that is warded against teleportation and planar travel. The demiplane can be a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or any similar confined structure or area of your choice.\n    The special component for this version of the spell is a miniature representation of the prison made from jade.\n    Minimus Containment. The target shrinks to a height of 1 inch and is imprisoned inside a gemstone or similar object. Light can pass through the gemstone normally (allowing the target to see out and other creatures to see in), but nothing else can pass through, even by means of teleportation or planar travel. The gemstone can\u2019t be cut or broken while the spell remains in effect.\n    The special component for this version of the spell is a large, transparent gemstone, such as a corundum, diamond, or ruby.\n    Slumber. The target falls asleep and can\u2019t be awoken. The special component for this version of the spell consists of rare soporific herbs.\n    Ending the Spell. During the casting of the spell, in any of its versions, you can specify a condition that will cause the spell to end and release the target. The condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you choose, but the GM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature\u2019s name, identity, or deity but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities and not based on intangibles such as level, class, or hit points.\n    A dispel magic spell can end the spell only if it is cast as a 9th level spell, targeting either the prison or the special component used to create it.\n    You can use a particular special component to create only one prison at a time.

Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature's existence.\n    To be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie's benefit."

You learn additional Cleric Cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table.\n    Preparing and Casting Spells. The Cleric table shows how many Spell Slots you have to cast your Spells of 1st Level and higher. To cast one of these Spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended Spell Slots when you finish a Long Rest.\n    You prepare the list of Cleric Spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the Cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of Cleric Spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your Cleric level (minimum of one spell). The Spells must be of a level for which you have Spell Slots.\n    For example, if you are a 3rd-level Cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level Spell Slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared Spells can include six Spells of 1st or 2nd Level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell Cure Wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared Spells.\n    You can change your list of prepared Spells when you finish a Long Rest. Preparing a new list of Cleric Spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per Spell Level for each spell on your list.\n    Spellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your Spellcasting Ability for your Cleric Spells. The power of your Spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a Cleric spell refers to your Spellcasting Ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Cleric spell you cast and when Making an Attack roll with one.\n    Ritual Casting. You can cast a Cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.\n    Spellcasting Focus.

You learn additional Wizard Cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.\n    Spellbook. At 1st Level, you have a Spellbook containing six 1st-level Wizard Spells of your choice. Your Spellbook is the repository of the Wizard Spells you know, except your Cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.\n    Preparing and Casting Spells. The Wizard table shows how many Spell Slots you have to cast your Spells of 1st Level and higher. To cast one of these Spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended Spell Slots when you finish a Long Rest.\n    You prepare the list of Wizard Spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of Wizard Spells from your Spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your Wizard level (minimum of one spell). The Spells must be of a level for which you have Spell Slots.\n    For example, if you're a 3rd-level Wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level Spell Slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared Spells can include six Spells of 1st or 2nd Level, in any combination, chosen from your Spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell Magic Missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared Spells.\n    You can change your list of prepared Spells when you finish a Long Rest. Preparing a new list of Wizard Spells requires time spent studying your Spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per Spell Level for each spell on your list.\n    Spellcasting Ability. Intelligence is your Spellcasting Ability for your Wizard Spells, since you learn your Spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your Spellcasting Ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Wizard spell you cast and when Making an Attack roll with one.\n    Ritual Casting. You can cast a Wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your Spellbook. You don't need to have the spell prepared.\n    Spellcasting Focus. You can use an arcane focus as a Spellcasting focus for your Wizard Spells.\n    Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher. Each time you gain a Wizard level, you can add two Wizard Spells of your choice to your Spellbook for free. Each of these Spells must be of a level for which you have Spell Slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your Adventures, you might find other Spells that you can add to your Spellbook (see \u201cYour Spellbook\u201d)."

See chapter 10 for the general rules of Spellcasting and chapter 11 for the druid spell list.\n    Cantrips. At 1st Level, you know two Cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn additional druid Cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.\n    Preparing and Casting Spells. The Druid table shows how many Spell Slots you have to cast your Spells of 1st Level and higher. To cast one of these Druid Spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended Spell Slots when you finish a Long Rest.\n    You prepare the list of Druid Spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of Druid Spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The Spells must be of a level for which you have Spell Slots.\n    For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level Spell Slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared Spells can include six Spells of 1st or 2nd Level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell Cure Wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level ar 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared Spells.\n    You can also change your list of prepared Spells when you finish a Long Rest. Preparing a new list of Druid Spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per Spell Level for each spell on your list.\n    Spellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your Spellcasting Ability for your Druid Spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and Attunement to Nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your Spellcasting Ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when Making an Attack roll with one.\n    Ritual Casting. You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.\n    Spellcasting Focus. You can use a druidic focus (see \"Equipment\") as a Spellcasting focus for your Druid Spells."

You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.\n    Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn\u2019t have a flying or swimming speed.\n\nBeast Shapes\n2nd Level. Max. CR: 1/4, Limitations: No flying or swimming speed, Example: Wolf\n4th Level. Max. CR: 1/2, Limitations: No flying speed, Example: Crocodile\n8th Level. Max. CR: 1, Limitations: None, Example: Giant eagle\n\n    You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.\n    While you are transformed, the following rules apply:\n\u2022 Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature\u2019s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.\n\u2022 When you transform, you assume the beast\u2019s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn\u2019t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren\u2019t knocked unconscious.\n\u2022 You can\u2019t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn\u2019t break your concentration on a spell you\u2019ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you\u2019ve already cast.\n\u2022 You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can\u2019t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.\n\u2022 You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature\u2019s shape and size. Your equipment doesn\u2019t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can\u2019t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form."

The Bard table shows how many Spell Slots you have to cast your Spells of 1st Level and higher. To cast one of these Spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended Spell Slots when you finish a Long Rest.\n    For example, if you know the 1st-level spell Cure Wounds and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast Cure Wounds using either slot.\n    Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher. You know four 1st-level Spells of your choice from the bard spell list.\n    You learn an additional bard spell of your choice at each level except 12th, 16th, 19th, and 20th. Each of these Spells must be of a level for which you have Spell Slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd Level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd Level.\n    Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the Bard Spells you know and replace it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have Spell Slots.\n    Spellcasting Ability. Charisma is your Spellcasting Ability for your Bard Spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the Performance of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your Spellcasting Ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when Making an Attack roll with one.\n    Ritual Casting. You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.\n    Spellcasting Focus. You can use a musical instrument (see \"Equipment\") as a Spellcasting focus for your Bard Spells."
