      <text>When the absorber takes damage from a spell, the absorber takes only half the triggering damage.

    <description>Resembling some sort of canine or feline quadruped at a distance, the absorber's monstrous nature becomes quickly apparent as it closes in. Named for its ability to draw magical energy into its body, the absorber can release that energy in devastating blasts through its tail, whose eye is constantly on the lookout for prey.
Created by Experimentation
Aeorian hunters were created through arcane experimentation on beasts and humanoids—both captives and volunteers. These experiments resulted in monstrosities with brightly colored flesh and the power to resist and destroy Aeor's enemies. It is theorized that the mages of Aeor must have possessed some means of controlling their monstrous soldiers, but no such device has yet been found in the wastes of Eiselcross. Draconic was the language used by these mages to train and bind the Aeorian hunters, and the hunters retain an understanding of this language even though they can't speak it.
Madness through Immortality. Aeorian hunters do not age. As such, the lust for violence their creators instilled in their minds has grown ravenous after centuries without war. Most immediately attack any creature they see.
Never Harm Another Hunter. Though they crave violence, Aeorian hunters have never been seen attacking each other. Most scholars believe that Aeor's mages must have enchanted this behavior into them, given the cost in gold and magic required to create each hunter. Some adventurers in Eiselcross boast about sneaking past Aeorian hunters using disguises or illusions to mimic a hunter's form, but these are most likely tall tales.
Ageless Memories. Each Aeorian hunter has perfect recall of every experience since the moment of its creation. Their limited intellects and desire for violence prevent them from effectively communicating, but each hunter holds a wealth of knowledge—often including the location of rare Aeorian relics—inside its mind.
Perfect Soldiers. Aeorian hunters don't require food or drink.

      <text>The nullifier's mouths gnash incoherently while it can see any enemies. Each creature that starts its turn within 20 feet of the nullifier and can hear it must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. Unless the save succeeds, the creature rolls a d8 to determine what it does during the current turn:</text>
      <text>1-4: The creature is stunned until the end of the turn.</text>
      <text>5-6: The creature is frightened until the end of the turn and uses its movement to get as far as possible from the nullifier.</text>

If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, its spell fails and has no effect. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, the nullifier makes a Charisma check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell's level. On a success, the creature's spell fails and has no effect.</text>

        <name>Innate Spellcasting</name>
      <text>The nullifier's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 16). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:</text>
      <text>At will: counterspell (see "Reactions" below), detect magic, dispel magic, see invisibility</text>
      <text>1/day: antimagic field</text>

    <description>Nullifiers are the bane of all magic users, with their physical forms and innate powers shaped specifically to resist and cancel magical effects. Against other foes, a nullifier is no less fearsome for the grotesque mouths filled with razor-sharp teeth that cover its torso—and which set up a cacophony of gnashing that can drive other creatures mad.

    <description>To mortals and monsters alike, the blood hunter is a legendary figure—a humanoid stalker said to embrace monstrous power. Long years ago, a group of mortals undertook dark rituals and alchemical experiments to gain the power of the deadliest monsters, allowing them to better hunt those monsters.
Blood hunters are steely on the surface, but roiling emotion lies beneath that impassive mask. Bestial fury and fathomless sorrow drive every stroke of a blood hunter's blade. Humanoids who draw the ire of a blood hunter are often in league with monsters—or the victims of a terrible misunderstanding. Such misunderstandings are tough to clear up, for blood hunters are the kind of folk to slay first and ask questions later.

Natural Hunters
Moorbounders hunt with elongated tusks and retractable claws. With a vague resemblance to large hunting cats, their muscular bodies are built for combat, granting them incredible prowess at leaping and a running speed that makes them dominant carnivores.

    <description>The smallest and most numerous of the core spawn, these eyeless creatures scurry through the subterranean darkness with the help of their four irregular, gangly arms and hooked prehensile tails. Core spawn crawlers rarely travel alone, and a group of these agile predators is known as a vein of crawlers. Their clattering taloned limbs warn of their presence as they scuttle through the shadow-haunted depths of the earth.
Offspring of Calamity
The aberrant creatures known as core spawn are a subterranean breed of heralds, servants, foot soldiers, and lieutenants of the Elder Evils, awakened in the depths by the cataclysmic actions of the Betrayer Gods and their minions. They often appear on the surface world in the wake of seismic events, such as that which created the bottomless Miskath Pit of Eastern Wynandir. Warlocks and cultists sometimes gather together to hasten the arrival of core spawn to the Material Plane, focusing their arcane power on areas of natural seismic instability when the signs and stars are right.

        <name>Berserk</name>
      <text>Whenever the golem starts its turn with 40 hit points or fewer, roll a d6. On a 6, the golem goes berserk. On each of its turns while berserk, the golem attacks the nearest creature it can see. If no creature is near enough to move to and attack, the golem attacks an object, with preference for an object smaller than itself. Once the golem goes berserk, it continues to do so until it is destroyed or regains all its hit points.</text>
      <text>The golem's creator, if within 60 feet of the berserk golem, can try to calm it by speaking firmly and persuasively. The golem must be able to hear its creator, who must take an action to make a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check. If the check succeeds, the golem ceases being berserk. If it takes damage while still at 40 hit points or fewer, the golem might go berserk again.</text>

    <description>An unknown Aeorian object of immense power and mystery was uncovered and brought to the Fortress of the Dead Jarl in Eiselcross to please the ruling frost giant, Conessa Berg. The object's unstable nature unleashed a burst of corroding arcane power, ravaging the denizens of the stronghold with twisting necromantic energies, transforming them into monstrous, rime-infused undead. These hulking brutes now wander the ruined landscape surrounding their cursed home, hunting and destroying all living things with a frightening ferocity.
The battered, butchered, and frozen remains of would-be heroes litter battle sites where these undead giants have been encountered. Underestimating these towering horrors has been the folly of numerous expeditions to the northern reaches of Eiselcross, with only rumors often finding their way back as proof that these frigid monsters even exist.

Frost worms are immune to this effect.</text>

    <description>Frost worms burrow through the snow, dirt, ice, and rock of Wildemount's Biting North. These enormous monstrosities eagerly consume any living creature they can wrap their jaws around.
A frost worm spends most of its time beneath the frozen ground, conserving energy while it waits for prey to pass overhead. Smart travelers can identify a frost worm's hunting grounds by looking for recently iced-over tunnels. When the worm senses vibrations above, it bursts forth through dirt, ice, and snow. Those who escape its initial assault must still contend with the worm's haunting trill—a hypnotizing call that stops creatures in their tracks to make them easy prey.

    <description>Desolate badlands and soggy marshes are home to the ancient and massive horizonback tortoises of Eastern Wynandir. Nearly fifty feet from nose to tail, and with a habit of remaining stationary for long periods, a horizonback tortoise is easy to mistake for a low hill at a distance. But when these impressive creatures rise to begin their march, the sight inspires fear and awe in equal parts. An omnivore of incredible size, these scavengers prefer to feed on dead vegetation, but make use of whatever edible matter they come across.

    <description>The wastes of Eastern Wynandir retain many curses and corruptions from the time of the Calamity, the worst of which pervert the sanctity of death. One such curse manifests as a terrible roving fog that draws the corpses of the fallen to rise as husk zombies—resilient undead of frightening speed and bloodlust. As well, some of the more heinous fiends that walk these scarred lands feed on the life force of the living, leaving these terrible undead in their wake.

    <description>Some of the many merrow that dwell in the watery shadows of the Menagerie Coast learn to harness the magical aspects of the elements. Often working as guides leading merrow hunting parties, some of these shallowpriests rise to become powerful leaders, inspiring their clans to terrorize coastal communities and passing ships.
Rumors speak of underground waterways and lakes carved into the rock beneath Wildemount, where shallowpriests hold court over huge subterranean communities of merrow. These evil creatures are thought to seek the means of flooding the surface world, allowing them to steal away who and what they will to the dark waters below.
While most shallowpriests do not bind themselves in the service of a specific deity, some are drawn to the worship of entities that reign over regions of the Elemental Plane of Water, hoping to find means of expanding their dominion into the seas of Exandria. These merrow often spearhead the construction of intricate shrines and temples along the bottom of the ocean, preparing a sacred space for planar doorways to their master's realm to be opened and maintained.

    <description>Natural Hunters
Moorbounders hunt with elongated tusks and retractable claws. With a vague resemblance to large hunting cats, their muscular bodies are built for combat, granting them incredible prowess at leaping and a running speed that makes them dominant carnivores.

An incapacitated target fails the save automatically. On a failed save, the creature takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage, and the nergaliid gains temporary hit points equal to the damage taken. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and the nergaliid doesn't gain temporary hit points. If this damage kills the target, its body rises at the end of the nergaliid's current turn as a husk zombie (see earlier in this chapter).</text>

    <description>Corpulent, scaled, and utterly repulsive, these vicious devils stalk the dark edges of society away from prying eyes, subsisting on the life force of unsuspecting humanoids. Creatures that die to the nergaliid's feeding leave a corrupted undead corpse behind known as a husk zombie (see earlier in this chapter).
The nergaliid favors feeding on the life force of sleeping humanoids, feasting on the same prey nightly—so long as its victim remains unaware. This ensures a lasting source of nourishment, with the victim beset by terrible nightmares as long as the feeding continues. When a nergaliid is discovered, it tries to strike a deal with the one who uncovered it. It might offer material wealth in exchange for freedom and silence. Only when an accord seems unlikely does the nergaliid attack.

      <text>• Pools of water that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it surge outward in a grasping tide. Any creature on the ground within 20 feet of such a pool must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 20 feet into the water and knocked prone.</text>

The cloud spreads around corners and remains until the dragon dismisses it as an action, uses this lair action again, or dies. The cloud is lightly obscured. Any creature in the cloud when it appears must make on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the cloud takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage.</text>
      <text>• Magical darkness spreads from a point the dragon chooses within 60 feet of it, filling a 15-foot-radius sphere until the dragon dismisses it as an action, uses this lair action again, or dies. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can't see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it.

      <text>Sahuagin warlocks of Uk'otoa who have exceptional potential in the eyes of the leviathan lord are granted a rod of retribution in addition to Uk'otoa's typical blessing, the Sword of Fathoms. A sahuagin warlock of Uk'otoa holding this rod gains the following reaction:</text>
      <text>Retribution (3/Day). When a creature the warlock can see within 60 feet of it damages the warlock, the creature must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 11 (2d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</text>

    <spells>eldritch blast, minor illusion, armor of Agathys, arms of Hadar, counterspell, crown of madness, invisibility, hunger of Hadar</spells>
    <description>The slumbering leviathan Uk'otoa preys on the fears and ambitions of humanoids that brave the depths of the Lucidian Ocean. Countless communities of sahuagin inhabit uncharted pockets of water along the Menagerie Coast, and the most ambitious among them often hear the call of the leviathan in their dreams, urging them to take his power and use it to achieve their bloodsoaked dreams.
Sahuagin who answer the call of Uk'otoa tend to have one ambition in common: vengeance against the land dwellers of the Clovis Concord for daring to sail oceans that do not belong to them. As these devotees receive dark boons from their leviathan lord, other sahuagin begin to gather to their side, drawn to their displays of power and seeking their own pathway to power. Over time, these warlocks eventually become empty husks, mere receptacles for Uk'otoa's power, and puppets that the slumbering leviathan can control as he pleases.

      <text>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the sea fury can take a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects, but can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</text>
      <text>• Caverns, tunnels, and pools of water within 120 feet of the sea fury become foggy or murky, to the extent that the area becomes heavily obscured.</text>
      <text>• The sea fury conjures a 15-foot cube of water that fills an unoccupied space it can see within 30 feet of it, then moves the water in a straight line up to 60 feet, after which the water disperses. Any creature that comes into contact with the rushing wave must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone by it and pushed 15 feet along its course.</text>
      <text>• The sea fury calls forth the spirit of a dead sailor or sea hag that met its end in the lair. This spirit has the statistics of a specter and lasts until the sea fury uses another lair action. The specter appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of the sea fury and obeys the sea fury's commands.</text>

      <text>• Sea grass within 1 mile of the lair is imbued with a foul mockery of life, grasping ineffectually at any creature that passes within 5 feet of it.</text>
      <text>• Ordinary crab and octopus within 1 mile of the lair grow in size to become giant crab and giant octopus, respectively. These creatures serve the sea fury as spies and guards.</text>

      </trait>
    <spells>witch bolt, bestow curse, fear, thunderwave</spells>
    <description>In times of great danger, sea hags form massive covens to channel powerful magic against outside threats. But when the threat is vanquished, these covens often destroy themselves from within. One sea hag grows more powerful than the others, killing its kin one by one and siphoning their magical power as it does so.
Driven to madness by the power it claims—and by the loneliness that is the cost of its killing spree—the hag becomes a sea fury, which hoards treasure, spreads rumors, and does everything within its power to lure sailors and explorers to its lair. By doing so, it hopes to break its loneliness for a time—and then to destroy its new playthings when they have outlived their usefulness.

    <description>Pearl divers and seafloor scavengers sometimes tell tales of mysterious ocean gardens filled with statues of sea creatures and sailors—the underwater grottoes of the deadly Swavain basilisk. Though named for the Swavain Islands where they are most commonly found, these dangerous hunters have been known to wander inland waterways, and have even been spotted in subterranean sewer systems.

    <description>Known commonly as the brutes of Xhorhas, these enormous creatures resemble an immense, demonic cross between ox and gorilla. Udaaks are solitary wanderers, found most commonly along the edges of settled lands in the barrens of Eastern Wynandir. Though they often scavenge for food, a hungry udaak will attack almost any prey, its four sets of red eyes and its tangle of teeth and tusks striking fear into the heart of any creature.
Living Siege Engine. Originally brought to Exandria from the Abyss, udaaks lost their connection to that realm after the Divergence and have roamed the world freely ever since. In recent years, the warmasters of the Kryn Dynasty have developed arcane collars that can keep an udaak under control, and they have begun using these dread creatures in the war against the Dwendalian Empire.
