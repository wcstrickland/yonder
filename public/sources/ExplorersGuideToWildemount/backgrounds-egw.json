The Cerberus Assembly preys upon talented individuals who have been broken by tragedy\u2014in some cases, tragedy that the Volstrucker has arranged for. A slightly broken mind is more easily reshaped and reeducated. Choose the tragedy that set you on this path, or roll on the Tragedies table.\nd6 | Tragedy\n1 | Familicide. Through deceit or manipulation, the Volstrucker convinced you to slaughter your own family.\n2 | Amnesia. You were forced to study magic so potent that it strained your mind beyond mortal limits, stealing away the memories of your past.\n3 | Capture. You were captured and tortured by agents of the Kryn Dynasty, and barely escaped.\n4 | Starvation. A terrible blight afflicted your rural village, and many of your friends and family members starved to death. You survived, but only barely.\n5 | Disfigurement. One of your arcane experiments went wrong and scarred or dismembered you so gravely that others now shun you. Only the Volstrucker showed you kindness after that day.\n6 | Vicissitude. You were once the scion of a wealthy family who lost their entire fortune in the blink of an eye."

If you write a letter in a special arcane ink, address it to a member of the Volstrucker, and cast it into a fire, the letter will burn to cinders and materialize whole again on the person of the agent you addressed it to.\nThe ink used to send a letter across the shadow network is the same as that used by a wizard to scribe spells in a spellbook.

The trauma that brings one into the order can fester even more strongly against the darkness of a Volstrucker agent's assignments. Officially, no one ever leaves the order\u2014but those desperate enough do whatever it takes to gain some measure of freedom.\nd6 | Personality Trait\n1 | I prefer to keep my thoughts to myself.\n2 | I indulge vice in excess to quiet my conscience.\n3 | I've left emotion behind me. I'm now perfectly placid.\n4 | Some event from the past keeps worming its way into my mind, making me restless.\n5 | I always keep my word\u2014except when I'm commanded to break it.\n6 | I laugh off insults and never take them personally.\n\nd6 | Ideal\n1 | Order. The will of the crown is absolute. (Law)\n2 | True Loyalty. The Cerberus Assembly is greater than any power, even the crown. (Law)\n3 | Death. The penalty for disloyalty is death. (Evil)\n4 | Determination. I cannot fail. Not ever. (Neutral)\n5 | Fear. People should not respect power. They should fear it. (Evil)\n6 | Escape. The Volstrucker are pure evil! I can't atone for what I've done for them, but I can escape with my life. (Any)\n\nd4 | Bond\n1 | The job is all that matters. I will see it through.\n2 | My orders are important, but my comrades are worth more than anything. I would die for them.\n3 | Everything I've done, I've done to protect someone close to me.\n4 | If the empire falls, all of civilization falls with it. I will hold back chaos and barbarism at any cost.\n\nd4 | Flaw\n1 | I drink to dull the pain in the back of my head.\n2 | I go a bit mad when I see blood.\n3 | I can hear the voices of everyone I've killed. I see their faces. I can't be free of these ghosts.\n4 | Fear is a powerful motivator. I will do whatever it takes to prevent those who know what I am from seeing me fail, and from those I care about from knowing what I am."
