Tall and slender, with dark hair and (illusory) feathered wings that gently fan the air, Aerisi Kalinoth speaks to her people in a whisper that belies her violent temper, which reveals itself whenever she is denied.\nAerisi was a sheltered moon elf princess named Dara Algwynenn Kalinoth who grew up in a remote Faerie realm. Her parents had wished to protect her from the harsh realities of the world, but they only succeeded in spoiling her. When they tried to discipline their wilful daughter, she used the power of elemental air against them. Soon after, her dreams led her to the ancient dwarven ruins where the spear Windvane awaited her.\nDara changed her name to Aerisi and pretended to be an avariel (winged elf) princess like the ones from her storybooks. Then Aerisi used her talents for enchantment magic to sway mortals into joining her cult. She has convinced all her followers that she is in fact an avariel, and believes it herself even though she must cast seeming each day to \"reveal\" her wings.\nAerisi is prone to deluded flights of fancy and impulsive decadence. She sees herself as a beautiful, fierce, and just ruler who wields elemental power because she deserves it.\nIn the Air Node. When danger threatens the Temple of Howling Hatred, Aerisi retreats to the Howling Caves, the air node. Within this node, Aerisi gains one additional use of her Legendary Resistance trait.\nSource: Princes of the Apocalypse p. 192",

He is currently intent on claiming the legendary axe Orcsplitter, the weapon buried with King Torhild Flametongue of Besilmer many centuries ago. The secret doors and puzzles of the Halls of the Hunting Axe have frustrated Drannin for a long time, but he now has a plan to dupe his cousin Gargosh into finding the axe for him (see the \"Halls of the Hunting Axe\" side trek in chapter 6). Drannin believes that with Orcsplitter in his possession he can establish himself as a powerful lord among his clan, and finally win the respect he thinks he deserves.\nDrannin's most prized possession is his shield guardian. He stole the amulet that controls the shield guardian from a sorcerer some years back.\nSource: Princes of the Apocalypse p. 210",

From the backs of hippogriffs or giant vultures, they survey the land around Feathergale Spire, guarding the entrance to the air cult's hidden temple.\nThe knights are contemptuous of other elemental cultists, whom they view as depraved lunatics. Under lord commander Thurl Merosska, the Feathergale Knights see themselves as elite men and women who can make hard choices for the good of their realms. In reality, they are bound to Yan-C-Bin and are blind to their own corruption and decadence. Despite their refined manners and social sophistication, each has sealed that pact with the murder of a sentient being-deaths the knights have dubbed necessary for the security of the realm.\nThe knights have access to wingwear, as described in the \"Elemental Magic Items\" section. They are often wearing it when encountered.\nSource: Princes of the Apocalypse p. 189",

He and Unferth serve as the Kraken Society's top operatives in this part of the North, and specialize in advancing the agenda of the society through theft, intimidation, and assassination.\nWhen the thieves' guild known as the Hand of Yartar comes into possession of a powerful elemental weapon (see the \"Dark Dealings in Yartar\" side trek in chapter 6), Ghald and Unferth make sure the Kraken Society comes in with the top bid. They then make sure that no one else interferes.\nSource: Princes of the Apocalypse p. 210",

The wind serves them at a gesture.\nHowling Hatred priests see themselves as living extensions of Yan-C-Bin, and they help new recruits cast off the shackles of their old lives and embrace a \"higher purpose.\" Once the new recruits are thus purified, the priests decide whether they are worthy for indoctrination as initiates or would better serve the Howling Hatred cult as sacrifices. The priests also uphold the doctrine of their prophet, inoth, and harshly punish any initiate who strays from the path.\nMost other air cultists hate the priests, though none dares to speak out against them. Those that challenge the priests often end up the subjects of rigorous new attempts at purification.\nSource: Princes of the Apocalypse p. 190",

His natural form resembles a 30-foot-tall, 10-foot-wide pillar of fire with smoldering black pits for eyes. Imix rarely speaks, but he crackles and roars with terrible laughter as anything combustible within his grasp bursts into flame and feeds his hate. Mortal beings are mere objects of contempt to Imix, and he burns alive any he can catch for nothing more than the wicked glee of watching them writhe and die in his flames.\nLike his native element, Imix is fickle, temperamental, and highly destructive. Anything combustible stokes his hunger, but he takes special delight in feeding on the handiwork and possessions of intelligent beings, such as crops, buildings, or goods. Imix doesn't even spare his own followers or those who placate him with gifts and sacrifices-he is capricious and unpredictable, and often turns on those who think they have earned his favor.\nImix's Lair. Imix's home is a fiery inverted pyramid within a volcano on the Elemental Plane of Fire. This fortress-palace is known as the Temple of Ultimate Consumption. Imix is quick to answer calls from the Material Plane, since he hungers eternally for new forests, plains, and kingdoms to burn.\nSource: Princes of the Apocalypse p. 214",

                "description": "The Prince of Evil Earth is Ogremoch (pronounced oh-gray-mock), the Mountain that Walks. His natural form is a shambling, 50-foot-tall colossus of rock, with crystal growths embedded throughout his body. When he bothers to speak, his voice sounds like grinding stones.\nOgremoch is a miser who regards all the resources and treasures found in the ground as his own. He holds nothing but contempt for mortals (or any other denizens of the Material Plane) and desires nothing more than to crush and subjugate whomever he encounters. What he can't crush, he endures and outlasts.\nOgremoch especially resents any mortals that dare to remove valuable metal or stone from the earth, and those who shape or build things of stone. He notices each nugget of gold or raw gemstone removed from areas under his influence, seeking to reclaim treasures \"stolen\" from him-and to punish the thieves. When the Prince of Evil Earth gains access to the Material Plane through an elemental node, he begins to methodically locate and destroy every mine, quarry, town, or fortification in the area. It's not that he needs the wealth, but the principle of the thing-extracting treasure from the earth-is anathema to Ogremoch.\nOgremoch's Lair. Ogremoch is normally found in the depths of elemental earth, choosing caverns with black crystals and jagged rock spikes to serve as his throne room. He can enter the Material Plane through large and well-established nodes of elemental earth, with a little help from the proper rituals. Within such a node, Ogremoch wields great power.\nSource: Princes of the Apocalypse p. 216",

Sometimes known as the Crushing Wave, the Dark Tide, or the Well of Endless Anguish, she takes the form of a great wave, 20 feet high and 15 feet wide, with opalescent eyes. She prefers to remain in or near large bodies of water-seas, lakes, rivers, or sometimes great subterranean pools. When she needs to, she can surge onto dry land, moving much like a wave rushing up onto the shore, but only great anger or desperation would drive Olhydra to move more than a few hundred feet from her native element.\nOlhydra surges forth tirelessly and relentlessly. She delights in creating dangerous and destructive manifestations of elemental water, especially maelstroms and floods. She is eager to assert her power by smashing any vessel that dares to venture into her realm, and lays waste to villages or towns established within her reach. Olhydra erodes that which she can't batter and drown; she is patient, retreating in the face of adversity only to return stronger than before.\nOf all the Princes of Elemental Evil, Olhydra is the one most interested in mortals. She recognizes that pirates and raiders who redden the waters with mortal blood (and occasionally send treasure-laden ships into her clutches) are agents of her hateful outlook, whether they know it or not. Consequently, Olhydra sometimes spares the worst sort of seafarers from her wrath, patiently waiting for the day when they deliver others into her power.\nOlhydra's Lair. The Princess of Evil Water is native to the Elemental Plane of Water, where she can be found in the black depths of vast seas or enthroned among jagged reefs. Olhydra waits for the chance to enter the Material Plane through elemental water nodes or when called by the proper rituals. Whether she is in her elemental domain or temporarily occupying a water node, Olhydra commands the waters around her and can shape them to her will.\nSource: Princes of the Apocalypse p. 218",

He was cruel almost from the time he could talk, catching small creatures and killing them in hideously inventive ways to savor the power of life and death. He grew to be an embarrassment to his well-off family, who paid a tutor to channel his undeniable intelligence and curiosity into more positive outlets. They didn't know they had apprenticed the young Oreioth to a necromancer in need of an assistant for his researches.\nWhen Oreioth's master decided he had no more use for his apprentice, he sent Oreioth off to make his own way in the world. Oreioth worked his way northward, robbing graves and using his magic to intimidate or rob anyone weaker than him. Driven out of one decent town after another, he finally sought refuge in an old outlaw's lair he discovered near Lance Rock. There he commenced his newest round of experiments, avoiding all other living souls.\nWhat few social graces Oreioth once possessed are fading rapidly. He has become a megalomaniac, styling himself the Lord of Lance Rock and surrounding himself with zombies and skeletons compelled to heed his every whim. Oreioth barely recognizes his own name anymore, and he harbors dreams of founding a kingdom of undead servitors with himself on the throne.\nSource: Princes of the Apocalypse p. 212",

He formed the Feathergale Society to lure likely individuals into the air cult. He indoctrinated his Feathergale knights, one by one, into the cult's beliefs.\nWhen Aerisi Kalinoth arose as the chosen prophet of air, Thurl reluctantly pledged the Feathergale Knights to the cause. He resents Aerisi Kalinoth's rulership of the cult, but tells himself that he can use her and her followers to make the Feathergale Society strong enough to rule Waterdeep as it should be ruled.\nSource: Princes of the Apocalypse p. 192",

When Aerisi was still with her family, Harald charmed and flattered his way into her favor. When Aerisi ran away from home to become the air prophet, she took Windharrow with her.\nAt Aerisi's insistence, Windharrow recruited a band of flutists from the ranks of new converts to the air cult, calling them the Windwyrds. Most have no musical talent whatsoever, and their music is often a shrill cacophony. Of all the air cultists, the Windwyrds are the least fanatical and the most fearful for their lives. Aerisi disposes of these minstrels on a whim, replacing them with other initiates. Those that master some skill with their instruments survive the longest, but the cost of failure creates a highly competitive environment among the minstrels.\nWindharrow is loyal to Aerisi Kalinoth as long as he fears her power. If his life is threatened or a richer offer presents itself, Windharrow betrays the air cult without a backward glance.\nSource: Princes of the Apocalypse p. 192",

Subtler than the other elemental princes, Yan-C-Bin operates unseen, studying his enemies from afar, ambushing them swiftly, and vanishing before his foes can retaliate.\nHis natural form is an invisible vortex of howling, swirling air 30 feet high and 15 feet wide, but Yan-C-Bin sometimes takes the shape of a gaunt, venerable, dark-skinned human with wispy white hair and glowing white eyes. When he wishes to remain unseen, Yan-C-Bin manifests only as a gust of cold wind flowing silently past.\nFrom his floating palace in the endless, cloudy skies of the Plane of Air, Yan-C-Bin watches worlds as they change over millennia. Evil aerial creatures worship the elemental prince as a god, and claim to see Yan-C-Bin's eyes in swirling storms. Yan-C-Bin doesn't care for their offerings, their sacrifices, or their worship. His only concern is the annihilation of the material realms as they are ripped apart by the superior elemental might of air and wind.\nYan-C-Bin's Lair.
