As there have been no sightings of the aldani in years, it is widely believed that they were wiped out. In truth, many aldani survived and retreated to the lakes of the Aldani Basin in the heart of Chult.\nAn aldani looks like a giant lobster that walks upright. Its face is mostly encased in armor, looking almost humanoid except for its long eyestalks. Despite their frightful appearance, aldani avoid conflict. Reclusive and xenophobic, they hide in their lakes and rivers.\nAldani Bribes. If disturbed, aldani try to frighten intruders away without killing them. When confronted by creatures who aren't easily startled, they offer bribes in exchange for being left alone. These bribes take the form of treasures that the aldani collect from the bottoms of rivers and lakes.\nCursed by Ubtao.  The aldani are the monstrous descendants of Chultan humans belonging to the Aldani tribe. The fishers of the tribe trapped the lobsters of the rivers by the thousands, until no lobsters remained. Their greed made Ubtao angry, and he cursed the fishers by transforming them into lobsterfolk. The fishers accepted their punishment and embraced their new existence. However, they were scorned by other members of their tribe and forced to take refuge in the rivers they had once plundered. Although the Aldani tribe went extinct, the lobsterfolk remain to this day.\nSource: Tomb of Annihilation p. 210",

The ring halts its wearer's natural aging and has allowed Artus to survive well beyond his natural lifespan. The ring also defies magical attempts to divine its location and that of its wearer. On his fingers above the knuckles, Artus has tattooed the names of his dearly departed animal companions-a pair of talking wombats named Byrt and Lugg.\nArtus has spent most of his life trying to keep the Ring of Winter out of evil hands, but his return to Chult is focused on reuniting with his beloved Alisanda, who disappeared along with the city of Mezro during the Spellplague. No longer content to wait for Alisanda and Mezro to return on their own, Artus has been seeking the means to bring them back. He believes that Saja N'baza, an ancient guardian naga, can help him. As such, his search has been focused on locating the ruins of Orolunga, where the naga is said to dwell. Fate has handed Artus a saurial traveling companion named Dragonbait, whom he met in Port Nyanzaru. The two are always on the move. Consequently, their location in the adventure is randomly determined.\nUsing Artus. Artus has never been to Omu, and he has no idea where the city is. However, he has a powerful artifact in his possession and a good heart. If the characters explain why they've come to Chult, Artus puts aside his personal quest and offers to help them find Omu and destroy the Soulmonger.\nThe first time a situation forces Artus to use the Ring of Winter, he warns the characters that evil forces are after the ring and that his presence in the party might put the characters in danger.\nArtus Cimber's Traits.

                "description": "An assassin vine is an ambulatory plant that collects its fertilizer by grabbing and crushing prey and depositing the carcasses near its roots. It usually stays put unless it needs to seek out prey. A mature plant consists of a main vine, about 20 feet long. Smaller vines up to 5 feet long branch from the main vine every 6 inches. In late summer, the secondary vines produce bunches of small fruits that resemble wild grapes. The fruit is tough and has a hearty but bitter flavor.\nA subterranean variant grows near hot springs, volcanic vents, and other sources of heat. An assassin vine growing underground usually generates enough offal to support a thriving colony of mushrooms and other fungi, which spring up around the plant and help conceal it.\nSource: Tomb of Annihilation p. 213, Ghosts of Saltmarsh, Essentials Kit: Sleeping Dragon's Wake",

Since an atropal was never truly alive, it can't be raised from the dead or resurrected by any means. Even divine intervention can't breathe true life into this hateful, miserable horror.\nAn atropal is malformed and unfinished. Its wet, wrinkled, and bloated body is surmounted by a hairless, overlarge head set with glassy, vacant eyes. It constantly drools stinking ichor as it mouths obscenities. Its arms are too slender, with tiny hands ending in cruelly shaped nails. An atropal never walks but always floats, with its atrophied, dead legs hanging useless below it.\nNegative Energy Connection. The shriveled umbilical cord of an atropal appears to trail off into nothingness, but in fact, it attaches to the Negative Plane. This connection gives the atropal power over death and undeath. The cord can be severed by a vorpal sword or other vorpal weapon, and doing so weakens the atropal's tie to the Negative Plane.\nAn atropal can summon vestiges of creatures that died in the Negative Plane, which manifest as wraiths. These servants can exist outside the Negative Plane only by the atropal's sheer force of will, and they quickly dissipate when the atropal is destroyed.\nUndead Nature. An atropal doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.\nSource: Tomb of Annihilation p. 214",

Painfully shy, chwingas prefer to move about unseen.\nIf two or more chwingas live in the same area, each one will take shelter in a different plant, rock, or body of fresh water. Though no two chwingas look exactly alike, they resemble 6-inch-tall animated dolls with strange masks, spindly limbs, and wild hair. Their appearance is sometimes foreshadowed by cool breezes, the sweet smell of flowers, and dancing fireflies. Their mere presence makes a natural setting more lush and vibrant.\nHumanoid Fascination. Chwingas shun most other creatures, but they find the trappings of civilization fascinating. They puzzle over creatures that wear armor, carry weapons, use tools, and cook food. When a chwinga encounters one or more humanoids, its curiosity sometimes gets the better of it, and it shadows those creatures for a short time to observe them. If it takes a liking to a particular humanoid, a chwinga might use its cantrips to aid it, or might bestow a magical gift before departing. The features that attract a chwinga to a particular humanoid can vary. In some cases, a chwinga might simply like the way a humanoid walks or the way it combs its hair. Other times, it might be smitten by a humanoid's ability to play music or to eat copious amounts of food.\nElemental Nature. Chwingas sleep but don't require air, food, or drink. They don't have names and have no ability to speak. When a chwinga dies, it turns into a handful of flower petals, a cloud of pollen, a stone statuette resembling its former self, a marble of smooth stone, or a puddle of fresh water.\nSource: Tomb of Annihilation p. 216",

                "description": "Dragonbait is a champion of good and a saurial-a race that originated on a distant world and whose members have long lives. Very few saurials dwell in the Forgotten Realms, and no saurial communities are believed to exist anywhere in the world.\nThe saurial's language is a combination of clicks and whistles beyond the human range of hearing, so Dragonbait tends to rely on scents to communicate emotions. To be understood by most speaking creatures, he must \"shout\" a scent. Dragonbait's known scents include: brimstone (confusion), roses (sadness), lemon (pleasure or joy), baked bread (anger), violets (danger or fear), honeysuckle (tenderness or concern), wood smoke (devotion or piety), tar (victory or celebration), and ham (nervousness or worry).\nDragonbait stands 4 feet 10 inches tall, weighs 150 pounds, and has a dry, wrinkled hide. He wields a holy avenger longsword and carries a blue, red, and white shield. Though he has traits in common with paladins, Dragonbait isn't a member of any class. Using an ability known as the Shen-state, he can determine the alignment of any creature within 60 feet of him.\nAn Unexpected Friendship. Dragonbait met Artus Cimber in Port Nyanzaru, and the two became fast friends. As Artus spoke of his quest to reunite with his wife, Alisanda, he was comforted by Dragonbait's quiet manner and unusual methods of communication. With a smile and a nod, Dragonbait agreed to help Artus. A frequent visitor to Chult, the saurial understood the dangers of the jungle all too well.\nUsing Dragonbait. Dragonbait has never been to Omu and doesn't know where the city is located. If the characters convince Artus Cimber to help them destroy the Soulmonger, Dragonbait wants to help as well.\nDragonbait's Traits. Ideal. Dragonbait emits a lemon scent while thinking about exploring the world, seeing its many wonders, and helping others along the way. (Translation: He has the heart of an explorer.)\nBond. Dragonbait gives off the scent of wood smoke while doing things to aid a friend's quest. (Translation: He would do anything for a friend.)\nFlaw. Dragonbait \"shouts\" the scent of ham while going where others fear to tread. (Translation: He will hurl himself into danger no matter how frightening.)\nSource: Tomb of Annihilation p. 218",

                "description": "The word \"ras\" is a noble title akin to \"duke.\" Ras Nsi was once a Chultan paladin, a Chosen of Ubtao and sworn protector of the city of Mezro. He betrayed his oaths and was banished from the city. Becoming a vengeful warlord, Ras Nsi attempted to conquer Mezro with an undead army but was defeated. Rather than seek redemption, he sought revenge and was stripped of his god-given powers. The undead horde, no longer under his control, spread throughout the jungles of Chult.\nWithdrawing to Omu, Nsi clung to his noble title, joined forces with the yuan-ti living there, and underwent a horrible ritual to become a powerful yuan-ti malison-retaining his human head and torso and gaining a serpentine lower body. With Ubtao gone from the world, Ras Nsi and his new yuan-ti followers began searching for a way to bring forth Dendar the Night Serpent. Acererak has promised to help this effort, in exchange for Ras Nsi's pledge to defend the Tomb of the Nine Gods. In truth, Acererak has no intention of honoring his bargain, and Ras Nsi is beginning to suspect as much.\nStrange Collection. Ras Nsi has a sizable collection of apparel and accouterments from distant lands, most of which were taken from dead explorers. The collection includes a fine Cormyrean cloak, a Sembian wine flask, and a bejeweled Amnian doublet and matching money pouch. He also bears a flame tongue longsword.\nSlow Death. Ras Nsi has died and been brought back from the dead more than once. Consequently, he is suffering from the effects of the Soulmonger's death curse. His hit point maximum has been reduced, and leprous wounds cover his flesh. In a fitting irony, Ras Nsi is unaware that Acererak is the cause of the curse, for neither he nor the yuan-ti are aware of what lies within the Tomb of the Nine Gods, other than the dead gods for which it is named. If the characters can make him understand that their efforts will help him, Ras Nsi might be tempted not to stand in their way.\nRas Nsi's Traits. Ideal. \"I seek to bring about the end of this world and rule the next one.\"\nBond. \"The yuan-ti of Chult are mine to command. They will help me rule an empire.\"\nFlaw. \"I will do anything and betray anyone to save myself.\"\nSource: Tomb of Annihilation p. 230",

They revere a fickle deity called the Cat Lord, who is said to wander the world.\nTabaxi hunters are trained to survive in the wild, making them excellent guides. Tabaxi minstrels gather in small troupes and make themselves at home in any settlement, earning coin through music and storytelling.\nNames. A tabaxi typically has a single name, determined by his or her clan and based on a complex formula involving astrology, prophecy, clan history, and other factors. Male and female tabaxi use the same names, and most use nicknames derived from or inspired by their full names. Tabaxi clan names are usually based on a geographical feature located in or near a clan's territory. Sample tabaxi names include Nest of Eggs (\"Eggs\"), Dead Leaf (\"Leaf\"), Eyes of Onyx (\"Onyx\"), Lost Spear (\"Lost\"), and Daylight Moon (\"Moon\"). Clan names include Distant Rain, Hundred Feathers, Sleeping Creek, Bright Cliffs, and Snoring Mountain.\nSource: Tomb of Annihilation p. 232",

They love to collect interesting artifacts, gather tales, and lay eyes on all the world's wonders. This curiosity pushes them to leave no secrets uncovered, and no treasures or legends lost. They revere a fickle deity called the Cat Lord, who is said to wander the world.\nTabaxi hunters are trained to survive in the wild, making them excellent guides. Tabaxi minstrels gather in small troupes and make themselves at home in any settlement, earning coin through music and storytelling.\nNames. A tabaxi typically has a single name, determined by his or her clan and based on a complex formula involving astrology, prophecy, clan history, and other factors. Male and female tabaxi use the same names, and most use nicknames derived from or inspired by their full names. Tabaxi clan names are usually based on a geographical feature located in or near a clan's territory. Sample tabaxi names include Nest of Eggs (\"Eggs\"), Dead Leaf (\"Leaf\"), Eyes of Onyx (\"Onyx\"), Lost Spear (\"Lost\"), and Daylight Moon (\"Moon\"). Clan names include Distant Rain, Hundred Feathers, Sleeping Creek, Bright Cliffs, and Snoring Mountain.\nSource: Tomb of Annihilation p. 233",

They further their own power at any cost, having no interest in the affairs of the living except where those affairs interfere with their own. Scheming and insane, they hunger for long-forgotten knowledge and the most terrible secrets. Because the shadow of death doesn't hang over them, they can conceive plans that take years, decades, or centuries to come to fruition.\nA lich is a gaunt and skeletal humanoid with withered flesh stretched tight across its bones. Its eyes succumbed to decay long ago, but points of light burn in its empty sockets. It is often garbed in the moldering remains of fine clothing and jewelry worn and dulled by the passage of time.\nBiography. Valindra Shadowmantle works for Szass Tam, the most powerful lich among the Red Wizards of Thay, though she is not a Red Wizard herself. She found the heart and converted it into a base to use while her minions search for the Soulmonger. Her orders from Szass Tam are to seize control of the Soulmonger, if possible, or destroy it otherwise. Valindra created a teleportation circle inside the heart that she uses to travel instantly to and from Thay (where her phylactery is safely stored), to deliver reports to Szass Tam and pick up new instructions.\nCharacters who explore the Heart of Ubtao are certain to meet Valindra. She's considered the possibility that adventurers might cross her path, and she won't necessarily be hostile toward them. Her mission is to seize the Soulmonger by any means; if adventurers can help her achieve that, she'll use them.\nWith her ability to appear as a living elf, Valindra can easily conceal her lichdom and her association to Thay. She presents herself as a scholarly wizard who wants to \"imprison\" the Soulmonger; that way, its unique magic can be studied while it's safely quarantined from the world. She argues that destroying it should be a last resort.\nSource: Tomb of Annihilation p. 58",
