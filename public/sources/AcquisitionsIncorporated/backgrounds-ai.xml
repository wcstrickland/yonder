        <name>Description</name>
      <text>Your family name strikes fear and admiration in the hearts of the common folk—but that's got nothing to do with you. Songs and stories celebrating the adventuring exploits of your famous parent are widely known. Kids across the land grew up wishing they were you. But being the child of a famous adventurer wasn't all hugs and kisses.
You seldom saw your celebrity-adventurer parent, and when they were around, it was all about them and tales of slaying this demon or vanquishing that dragon. All too often, you'd be woken out of a sound sleep by someone standing outside your home screaming about the latest threat to the town, the region, or the world.
In the end, all you have to show for your lineage is your name. Most of the family's money went for consumables, from potions of healing and spell scrolls to copious amounts of dwarven ale. And everyone expects you to swing a sword or sling spells like your famous forebear, making it doubly hard for you to prove yourself.

      <text>You know and have met any number of powerful people across the land—and some of them might even remember you. You might be able to wrangle minor assistance from a major figure in the campaign, at the DM's discretion. Additionally, the common folk treat you with deference, and your heritage and the stories you tell might be good for a free meal or a place to sleep.

      <text>Scions of celebrity adventurers must deal with fame that's not theirs, wealth they didn't earn, and expectations they can never hope to meet. These hardships can have adverse effects, but those who cope with them can arrive at a decent attitude and a grounded worldview. Those who fail become bitter—or worse.
d8 | Personality Trait
1 | I will never get out of my famous parent's shadow, and no one else will ever understand this burden.
2 | I've seen enough of the adventuring life to have realistic expectations and empathy for my peers.
3 | Living up to my legacy will be difficult, but I'm going to do it.
4 | I'm used to the very best in life, and that's a hard habit to break.
5 | My parent taught me a sense of duty. I strive to uphold it, even when the odds are against me.
6 | No one can fake a smile, a handshake, or an interested nod like I can.
7 | I've been part of the adventuring life since I was old enough to walk. Let me explain a few things to you.
8 | No risk is too great for the rewards of defeating my enemies... and taking their stuff.

d6 | Ideal
1 | Power. The only way to get ahead in this world is to attain power and hold onto it with all your might. (Evil)
2 | Peace. Those who can find or make peace in the chaotic world around them have everything. (Lawful)
3 | Fame. I've seen what fame can bring. And I'll do anything to get all that for myself. (Neutral)
4 | Training. Hard work, sacrifice, and training lead to success—and eventually to perfection. (Any)
5 | Anonymity. I want to be successful. And alone. With lots of guards and wards between me and everyone else in the world. (Any)
6 | Wisdom. Material wealth is an illusion. Wisdom is the real treasure. (Good)

d6 | Bond
1 | While my parent was out adventuring, a servant raised me, and I care about that person more than anyone.
2 | I consider every member of my parent's former adventuring party to be family.
3 | Despite their absences, my famous parent was kind and generous. I love them and want to make them proud.
4 | My parent once brought a cursed magic item home. It is my obsession.
5 | My childhood home holds all my best memories, and its upkeep is my primary concern.
6 | Growing up, I had an imaginary friend I could always count on. That friend is still with me.

d6 | Flaw
1 | You don't know what I'm going through. You never can.
2 | You. Fetch my cloak. And maybe rub my feet for a while.
3 | My comrades are brave, but I must defeat this threat alone to prove my worth.
4 | Oh, yeah, that spell? Named after my parent's best friend. Let me tell you about them.
5 | My best days are behind me. Ahead lies only toil, pain, and death.
6 | You have to look out for yourself. No one else will.

      <text>Maybe you come from a long line of merchants. Perhaps you were an entrepreneur. Regardless, your ventures ended poorly. Whether it was because of outside influences, bad luck, or simply because your business acumen was weak, you lost everything.
With failure, however, comes experience. You're free of that old life, having made some connections and learned your lessons. Prepared to pursue the life of an adventurer, your insight into the world of commerce brought you into the sphere of Acquisitions Incorporated—and a franchise just might be in your future.

        <name>Feature: Supply Chain</name>
      <text>From your time as a merchant, you retain connections with wholesalers, suppliers, and other merchants and entrepreneurs. You can call upon these connections when looking for items or information.
</text>
      </trait>
    <trait>
        <name>Suggested Characteristics</name>
      <text>Being a merchant involved having a head for numbers, a strong personality, the ability to make deals with hostile adversaries, a strong sword arm to fight off bandits, and the intuition for knowing what people want and need. The art of business is the art of finding the best path to profit, and that path might be different with each transaction. It takes a strong mind and a stronger stomach to succeed. So why did you fail?
d8 | Personality Trait
1 | I didn't have the cutthroat attitude necessary to succeed. I won't make that mistake again.
2 | Even my competitors said I was affable and talented. Those traits should serve me well.
3 | To prosper, you have to be in control.
4 | The customer is always right.
5 | I was cutting corners and breaking deals to maximize profit. That's why I failed.
6 | When I get an idea, I am single-minded in its execution—even if it's a terrible idea.
7 | If I can be everyone's friend, I'll always have support.
8 | My heart wasn't in being a merchant, so I failed. I'm not all that keen on adventuring either, but I need the money.

d6 | Ideal
1 | Survival. Where there's life, there's hope. If I remain alive and flexible, I can succeed. (Any)
2 | Generosity. People helped me when I was down. Now that I'm back on my feet, I'll pay it forward. (Good)
3 | Excitement. Caution got me nowhere in my previous business. I'm not going to let it hold me back now. (Chaotic)
4 | Wealth. With enough coin, I can buy comfort, power, knowledge, and even eternal life. Nothing will stand between me and money. (Evil)
5 | Stability. The mercantile trade was too chaotic for me. I need a nice stable profession, like adventuring. (Lawful)
6 | Redemption. Too many people consider me a failure. So I need to prove them wrong. (Any)

d6 | Bond
1 | My family means everything to me. I failed them before, and I must not do so again.
2 | My church provides a connection to my god, so I must ensure that it is protected and funded.
3 | My former business partner fell ill, and then our business failed. Part of my new venture involves earning enough to take care of their family.
4 | If I take care of my possessions, they'll take care of me. People come and go, but a weapon or a wand is something you can always rely on.
5 | Although my business failed, the people of my community were kind to me. I'll do everything in my power to protect them.
6 | I owe a dangerous person a lot of money. As long as they're happy, they let my debt rest unpaid.

d6 | Flaw
1 | Why spend gold here when you can buy the same thing for copper in the next town?
2 | I must have the best of everything. Like, right now.
3 | You haven't heard of me? I'm sure that's because of your ignorance and low breeding.
4 | I failed, but I'm awesome. So when anyone else is successful, it must be because of nepotism, dishonesty, or dumb luck.
5 | I find that most people are trustworthy. Hey, where's my belt pouch?
6 | Nothing gets between me and danger except my fellow adventurers. So I'll be sure to put them there.

      <text>All you need to make a lot of gold is a little gold. Except at those times when all you need to have no gold at all is a little gold. Whether you're a good gambler or a bad one rarely matters, because no one can divine the whims of Lady Luck. Sometimes you're up, sometimes you're down. But the thing about gambling is that someone is always willing to take a bet.

      <text>Odds and probability are your bread and butter. During downtime activities that involve games of chance or figuring odds on the best plan, you can get a solid sense of which choice is likely the best one and which opportunities seem too good to be true, at the DM's determination.

        <name>Suggested Characteristics</name>
      <text>Some gamble out of necessity. Others do so out of boredom. Still others become addicted to the thrill of winning or losing everything on a turn of fortune. For some, gambling is less a matter of chance and more a matter of seeking every advantage to ensure the outcome. The best gamblers can lose everything, and the worst gamblers sometimes win. Regardless, you can always tell gamblers by the look in their eyes. Lady Luck haunts them.
d8 | Personality Trait
1 | I plan for every contingency. Leave nothing to chance!
2 | Every copper wants to be a silver. Each bet is an opportunity.
3 | I'm one of Lady Luck's favored. Anything I try is destined to succeed.
4 | I've lost so much to gambling that I refuse to spend money on anything anymore.
5 | Nothing is certain. Planning is a coward's act.
6 | I can't be sure who I've swindled, cheated, or defeated, so I keep a low profile in public.
7 | The perfect bet is out there somewhere. I just have to keep my eyes open.
8 | I have beaten my addiction, but all it takes is one weak moment and I'll be back at the card table.

d6 | Ideal
1 | Knowledge. Knowledge is power, and knowing which horse to back is the key to success. (Any)
2 | Fate. Whatever happens is fated, regardless of any planning or striving. (Lawful)
3 | Bravery. If you want to succeed, you have to take risks. (Chaotic)
4 | Survival. You can't win if you're dead. Live to fight another day—when the odds might be more in your favor. (Any)
5 | Reliability. When I was in need, I was able to rely on others. Now I want to be the one others rely on. (Good)
6 | Victory. Winning is the real measure of a person. In the end, the only thing that matters is the scoreboard. (Evil)

d6 | Bond
1 | One person in particular owes me a lot of money, and I need to keep them alive if I want to be repaid.
2 | I'm loyal to the friend or family member who taught me how to gamble.
3 | The person who saved me from my gambling addiction is the only reason I'm alive today.
4 | A patron once fronted me money in exchange for a percentage of my winnings. I owe them a debt of gratitude. And a lot of cash.
5 | A criminal syndicate I once played for isn't happy I left the game, and its enforcers are looking for me.
6 | Urchins once helped me find marks for my games. Now I'm driven to help them escape the streets.

d6 | Flaw
1 | I don't know when to quit. Especially when everyone else is telling me to.
2 | I save my sympathy for my friends, and I have no friends.
3 | You think we're in trouble now? Let me tell you how bad things are likely to get!
4 | You can loan me a little, right? I've got a sure thing. I'll double your money, guaranteed.
5 | I was once a terribly flawed person, like you. Let me tell you how you can save yourself.
6 | I'm a great gambler. I'm just bad at math and logic.

      <text>Sure, accidents happen. But they seem to happen an awful lot when Acquisitions Incorporated operatives are on the scene.

      <text>Your experience with your local legal system has given you a firm knowledge of the ins and outs of that system. Even when the law is not on your side, you can use complex terms like ex injuria jus non oritur and cogitationis poenam nemo patitur to frighten people into thinking you know what you're talking about. With common folks who don't know any better, you might be able to intimidate or deceive to get favors or special treatment.
