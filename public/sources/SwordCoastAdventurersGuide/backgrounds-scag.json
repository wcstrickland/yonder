The goals and philosophies of the order are more important than the gear and fighting style of its members, and so most of these orders aren't limited to fighting types, but are open to all sorts of folk who are willing to battle and die for the order's cause.\nThe \"Knightly Orders of Faer\u00fbn\" sidebar details several of the orders that are active at present and is designed to help inform your decision about which group you owe allegiance to.\n\u2022 Skill Proficiencies: Persuasion, plus one from among Arcana, History, Nature, and Religion, as appropriate for your order\n\u2022 Tool Proficiencies: Your choice of a gaming set or a musical instrument\n\u2022 Languages: Any one of your choice\n\u2022 Equipment: One set of traveler's clothes, a signet, banner, or seal representing your place or rank in the order, and a pouch containing 10 gp\nSource: Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide p. 151"

Other knighthoods are secular and nongovernmental organizations of warriors who follow a particular philosophy, or consider themselves a kind of extended family, similar to an order of monks. Although there are organizations, such as the Knights of the Shield, that use the trappings of knighthood without necessarily being warriors, most folk of Faer\u00fbn who hear the word \"knight\" think of a mounted warrior in armor beholden to a code.
