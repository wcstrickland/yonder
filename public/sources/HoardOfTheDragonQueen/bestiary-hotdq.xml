    <trait>
        <name>Shapechanger</name>
      <text>If Sandesyl isn't in sunlight or running water, it can use its action to polymorph into a Tiny bat or a Medium cloud of mist, or back into its true form.</text>
      <text>While in bat form, Sandesyl can't speak, its walking speed is 5 feet, and it has a flying speed of 30 feet. Its statistics, other than its size and speed, are unchanged. Anything it is wearing transforms with it, but nothing it is carrying does. It reverts to its true form if it dies.</text>
      <text>While in mist form, Sandesyl can't take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and it can't pass through water. It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and it is immune to all nonmagical damage, except the damage it takes from sunlight.</text>

        <name>Misty Escape</name>
      <text>When it drops to 0 hit points outside its resting place, Sandesyl transforms into a cloud of mist (as in the Shapechanger trait) instead of falling unconscious, provided that it isn't in sunlight or running water. If it can't transform, it is destroyed.</text>
      <text>While it has 0 hit points in mist form, it can't revert to its vampire form, and it must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in its resting place, it reverts to its vampire form. It is then paralyzed until it regains at least 1 hit point. After spending 1 hour in its resting place with 0 hit points, it regains 1 hit point.</text>
      </trait>
    <trait>
        <name>Regeneration</name>
      <text>Sandesyl regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and isn't in sunlight or running water. If Sandesyl takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn't function at the start of Sandesyl's next turn.</text>

      <text>Sandesyl has the following flaws:</text>
      <text>Forbiddance. Sandesyl can't enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants.</text>
      <text>Harmed by Running Water. Sandesyl takes 20 acid damage if it ends its turn in running water.</text>
      <text>Stake to the Heart. If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into Sandesyl's heart while Sandesyl is incapacitated in its resting place, Sandesyl is paralyzed until the stake is removed.</text>

The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and Sandesyl regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following night as a vampire spawn under Sandesyl's control.</text>
      <attack>Bite (Bat or Vampire Form Only)|+9|1d6+4</attack>

    <action>
        <name>Charm</name>
      <text>Sandesyl targets one humanoid it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see Sandesyl, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be charmed by Sandesyl. The charmed target regards Sandesyl as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under Sandesyl's control, it takes Sandesyl's requests or actions in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for Sandesyl's bite attack.</text>
      <text>Each time Sandesyl or Sandesyl's companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until Sandesyl is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect.</text>

      <text>• There's a noticeable increase in the populations of bats, rats, and wolves in the region.</text>
      <text>• Plants within 500 feet of the lair wither, and their stems and branches become twisted and thorny.</text>
      <text>• Shadows cast within 500 feet of the lair seem abnormally gaunt and sometimes move as though alive.</text>
      <text>• A creeping fog clings to the ground within 500 feet of the vampire's lair. The fog occasionally takes eerie forms, such as grasping claws and writhing serpents.</text>
      <text>If the vampire is destroyed, these effects end after 2d6 days.</text>
