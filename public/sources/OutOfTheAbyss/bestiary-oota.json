He gnashes his teeth if he has to address the characters, taking every opportunity to be insulting and misleading. If the characters look through his satchel while he's still conscious, he throws an epic tantrum and becomes intractable until knocked unconscious.\nDroki is also obsessed with things happening where and when they should. If he is captured before he runs his errands in the Whorlstone Tunnels, he constantly complains about the characters altering fate by delaying him, and a good tactic to pressure him is to threaten to hold him indefinitely. He prefers to escape than to fight, except if the characters take his satchel.\nSource: Out of the Abyss p. 231",

He offers them divine guidance and vengeance against their enemies while urging them on toward greater acts of tyranny, all the while concealing his true identity.\nDuergar Keeper of the Flame. The Keepers of the Flame is a well-respected order of psionic clerics that serves the red dragon Themberchaud in Gracklstugh, and whose members are advisors to the Deepking.\nThe duergar Keeper of the Flame uses the same statistics as the duergar in the Monster Manual, except that its challenge rating is 2 (450 XP) and it has the following additional features.\nInnate Spellcasting (Psionics). The Keeper of the Flame's innate spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 12). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:\nAt will: friends, message\n3/day: command\nSpellcasting. The Keeper of the Flame is a 3rd-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 12, +4 to hit with spell attacks). The Keeper of the Flame has the following cleric spells prepared:\nCantrips (at will): guidance, mending, sacred flame\n1st level (4 slots): bane, inflict wounds, shield of faith\n2nd level (2 slots): enhance ability, spiritual weapon\nSource: Out of the Abyss p. 226",

Many creatures mistake ixitxachitl for common manta rays, but this can prove a deadly mistake. The ixitxachitl are as evil as they are cunning, leading to their common nickname \"demon rays.\" They inhabit bodies of fresh and salt water, but their violent nature means that little is known of them.\nStruggle for Survival.  Ixitxachitl emerge from eggs as tiny creatures little more than a hand span in width. From that time onward, they struggle to survive at all costs, growing throughout their lives. Those ixitxachitl that master the secrets of survival gain powers of regeneration and feed on the life force of other creatures.\nAll Consuming. Ixitxachitl hollow out coral reefs or other natural aquatic formations to create labyrinthine dens, often compelling aid from captured aquatic species they enslave. They typically strip an area bare before moving on to new fertile grounds, leaving their abandoned dens behind. Schools of ixitxachitl often war on other aquatic creatures to claim feeding grounds and territory.\nDemon Worshipers. The ixitxachitl venerate and serve various demons, particularly Demogorgon, whom they consider their patron and creator. They have an intense rivalry with the merrow over which of them are the greatest and most favored servants of the Prince of Demons.\nVariant: Ixitxachitl Cleric.

Many creatures mistake ixitxachitl for common manta rays, but this can prove a deadly mistake. The ixitxachitl are as evil as they are cunning, leading to their common nickname \"demon rays.\" They inhabit bodies of fresh and salt water, but their violent nature means that little is known of them.\nStruggle for Survival.  Ixitxachitl emerge from eggs as tiny creatures little more than a hand span in width. From that time onward, they struggle to survive at all costs, growing throughout their lives. Those ixitxachitl that master the secrets of survival gain powers of regeneration and feed on the life force of other creatures.\nAll Consuming. Ixitxachitl hollow out coral reefs or other natural aquatic formations to create labyrinthine dens, often compelling aid from captured aquatic species they enslave. They typically strip an area bare before moving on to new fertile grounds, leaving their abandoned dens behind. Schools of ixitxachitl often war on other aquatic creatures to claim feeding grounds and territory.\nDemon Worshipers. The ixitxachitl venerate and serve various demons, particularly Demogorgon, whom they consider their patron and creator. They have an intense rivalry with the merrow over which of them are the greatest and most favored servants of the Prince of Demons.\nVariant: Ixitxachitl Cleric.
