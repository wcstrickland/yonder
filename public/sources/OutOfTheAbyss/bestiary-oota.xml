    <description>This creature is an ordinary zurkhwood mushroom (see "Fungi of the Underdark" in chapter 2) given sentience and mobility. An awakened zurkhwood can be created by casting the awaken spell on a normal zurkhwood mushroom. A myconid sovereign can create one by performing a lengthy ritual.
An awakened zurkhwood has the same statistics as an awakened tree (see appendix A of the Monster Manual), with the following modifications:
• The awakened zurkhwood has darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.
• If the awakened zurkhwood was created by a myconid sovereign, it can't speak.
• The awakened zurkhwood's False Appearance feature allows it to be mistaken for a normal zurkhwood mushroom (instead of a tree).

On a successful save, the creature can't be infected by these spores for 24 hours. On a failed save, the creature is infected with a disease called the spores of Zuggtmoy and also gains a random form of indefinite madness (determined by rolling on the Madness of Zuggtmoy table in appendix D) that lasts until the creature is cured of the disease or dies. While infected in this way, the creature can't be reinfected, and it must be repeat the saving throw at the end of every 24 hours, ending the infection on a success. On a failure, the infected creature's body is slowly taken over by fungal growth, and after three such failed saves, the creature dies and is reanimated as a spore servant if it's a type of creature that can be (see the "Myconids" entry in the Monster Manual).</text>

    <description>Roleplaying Droki. Droki hates everyone in general and surfacers in particular. He gnashes his teeth if he has to address the characters, taking every opportunity to be insulting and misleading. If the characters look through his satchel while he's still conscious, he throws an epic tantrum and becomes intractable until knocked unconscious.
Droki is also obsessed with things happening where and when they should. If he is captured before he runs his errands in the Whorlstone Tunnels, he constantly complains about the characters altering fate by delaying him, and a good tactic to pressure him is to threaten to hold him indefinitely. He prefers to escape than to fight, except if the characters take his satchel.

    <description>The tyrannical duergar, also known as gray dwarves, dwell in fantastic cities deep in the Underdark. Using ancient dwarven knowledge and myriad slaves, they work tirelessly to expand their subterranean kingdoms.
Most duergar (including females) are bald and have ashen gray skin. They wear drab clothing designed to blend in with stone, along with simple jewelry that reflects their severe and utilitarian demeanor.
Slaves to Slavers. The duergar were once dwarves, before their greed and endless delving beneath the earth brought them into contact with the mind flayers. Held in captivity for generations by the illithids, the dwarves eventually won their independence with the aid of the evil god Laduguer. Slavery had forever changed them, however, darkening their spirits to make the duergar as evil as the tyrants they had escaped. Despite winning their freedom, duergar are dour, pessimistic, untrusting creatures, always toiling and complaining, with no memory of what it means to be happy or proud. Their craftsmanship and accomplishments endure, yet they are bereft of warmth or artistry.Duergar make war against their dwarven kin and all other subterranean races. They forge alliances when it is convenient, then break those alliances when they have nothing more to gain. They take and hold slaves to toil in the Underdark, regarding them as free labor and crude currency.
Tough as Stone. Like dwarves, duergar have strong constitutions. Adding to their physical stamina is an incredible mental fortitude resulting from their time as slaves of the illithids. A duergar's mind is a fortress, able to shrug off charms, illusions, and other spells.Born of Darkness. The Underdark is saturated with strange magical power, which the duergar absorbed over generations of imprisonment. A duergar can increase its size and strength for a short time, becoming a powerful ogre-sized warrior. If it faces a foe it can't fight, or when spying on creatures approaching its territory, it can just as easily become invisible to slip away into the darkness. Eons spent in the Underdark also sharpened their darkvision, allowing them to see twice as far as other dwarves. This keen eyesight comes at a cost, however, as a duergar's vision is compromised by sunlight.
Infernal Master. Asmodeus, Lord of the Nine Hells, has been known to impersonate duergar gods in order to cultivate the evil brimming in the hearts of the gray dwarves. He offers them divine guidance and vengeance against their enemies while urging them on toward greater acts of tyranny, all the while concealing his true identity.
Duergar Darkhaft. The darkhafts are the members of the Deepking's secret corps of psionic agents.

    <description>Ixitxachitl (pronounced ick-zit-zah-chit-ul) are aquatic creatures resembling manta rays, with small, clawed hands at the ends of their "wings" and black eyes gleaming with sinister intelligence. Many creatures mistake ixitxachitl for common manta rays, but this can prove a deadly mistake. The ixitxachitl are as evil as they are cunning, leading to their common nickname "demon rays." They inhabit bodies of fresh and salt water, but their violent nature means that little is known of them.
Struggle for Survival.  Ixitxachitl emerge from eggs as tiny creatures little more than a hand span in width. From that time onward, they struggle to survive at all costs, growing throughout their lives. Those ixitxachitl that master the secrets of survival gain powers of regeneration and feed on the life force of other creatures.
All Consuming. Ixitxachitl hollow out coral reefs or other natural aquatic formations to create labyrinthine dens, often compelling aid from captured aquatic species they enslave. They typically strip an area bare before moving on to new fertile grounds, leaving their abandoned dens behind. Schools of ixitxachitl often war on other aquatic creatures to claim feeding grounds and territory.
Demon Worshipers. The ixitxachitl venerate and serve various demons, particularly Demogorgon, whom they consider their patron and creator. They have an intense rivalry with the merrow over which of them are the greatest and most favored servants of the Prince of Demons.
Variant: Ixitxachitl Cleric. Some ixitxachitl and vampiric ixitxachitl are able to cast divine spells. Such a creature gains the following feature.
Spellcasting. The ixitxachitl is a 5th-level spellcaster that uses Wisdom as its spellcasting ability (spell save DC 11, +3 to hit with spell attacks). The ixitxachitl has the following cleric spells prepared:
Cantrips (at will): guidance, thaumaturgy
1st Level (4 slots): charm person, create or destroy water
2nd Level (3 slots): hold person, silence
3rd Level (2 slots): dispel magic, tongues

      <text>2. Paralyzing Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</text>
      <text>3. Fear Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</text>
      <text>4. Slowing Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target's speed is halved for 1 minute. In addition, the creature can't take reactions, and it can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</text>
      <text>5. Enervation Ray. The targeted creature must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</text>
      <attack>Eye Rays||8d8</attack>
      <text>6. Telekinetic Ray. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or the beholder moves it up to 30 feet in any direction. It is restrained by the ray's telekinetic grip until the start of the beholder's next turn or until the beholder is incapacitated.</text>
      <text>If the target is an object weighing 300 pounds or less that isn't being worn or carried, it is moved up to 30 feet in any direction. The beholder can also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as manipulating a simple tool or opening a door or a container.</text>

        <text>When fighting inside its lair, a beholder can invoke the ambient magic to take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the beholder can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects:</text>
      <text>• A 50-foot-square area of ground within 120 feet of the beholder becomes slimy; that area is difficult terrain until initiative count 20 on the next round.</text>
      <text>• Walls within 120 feet of the beholder sprout grasping appendages until initiative count 20 on the round after next. Each creature of the beholder's choice that starts its turn within 10 feet of such a wall must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be grappled. Escaping requires a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.</text>
      <text>• An eye opens on a solid surface within 60 feet of the beholder. One random eye ray of the beholder shoots from that eye at a target of the beholder's choice that it can see. The eye then closes and disappears.</text>
      <text>The beholder can't repeat an effect until they have all been used, and it can't use the same effect two rounds in a row.</text>

      </legendary>
    <legendary>
        <text>A region containing a beholder's lair is warped by the creature's unnatural presence, which creates one or more of the following effects:</text>
      <text>• Creatures within 1 mile of the beholder's lair sometimes feel as if they're being watched when they aren't.</text>
      <text>• When the beholder sleeps, minor warps in reality occur within 1 mile of its lair and then vanish 24 hours later. Marks on cave walls might change subtly, an eerie trinket might appear where none existed before, harmless slime might coat a statue, and so on. These effects apply only to natural surfaces and to nonmagical objects that aren't on anyone's person.</text>
      <text>If the beholder dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.</text>

    <description>Ixitxachitl (pronounced ick-zit-zah-chit-ul) are aquatic creatures resembling manta rays, with small, clawed hands at the ends of their "wings" and black eyes gleaming with sinister intelligence. Many creatures mistake ixitxachitl for common manta rays, but this can prove a deadly mistake. The ixitxachitl are as evil as they are cunning, leading to their common nickname "demon rays." They inhabit bodies of fresh and salt water, but their violent nature means that little is known of them.
Struggle for Survival.  Ixitxachitl emerge from eggs as tiny creatures little more than a hand span in width. From that time onward, they struggle to survive at all costs, growing throughout their lives. Those ixitxachitl that master the secrets of survival gain powers of regeneration and feed on the life force of other creatures.
All Consuming. Ixitxachitl hollow out coral reefs or other natural aquatic formations to create labyrinthine dens, often compelling aid from captured aquatic species they enslave. They typically strip an area bare before moving on to new fertile grounds, leaving their abandoned dens behind. Schools of ixitxachitl often war on other aquatic creatures to claim feeding grounds and territory.
Demon Worshipers. The ixitxachitl venerate and serve various demons, particularly Demogorgon, whom they consider their patron and creator. They have an intense rivalry with the merrow over which of them are the greatest and most favored servants of the Prince of Demons.
Variant: Ixitxachitl Cleric. Some ixitxachitl and vampiric ixitxachitl are able to cast divine spells. Such a creature gains the following feature.
Spellcasting. The ixitxachitl is a 5th-level spellcaster that uses Wisdom as its spellcasting ability (spell save DC 11, +3 to hit with spell attacks). The ixitxachitl has the following cleric spells prepared:
Cantrips (at will): guidance, thaumaturgy
1st Level (4 slots): charm person, create or destroy water
2nd Level (3 slots): hold person, silence
3rd Level (2 slots): dispel magic, tongues

      <text>If a creature starts its turn within 30 feet of Veldyskar and the two of them can see each other, Veldyskar can force the creature to make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw if Veldyskar isn't incapacitated. On a failed save, the creature magically begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed by the  greater restoration spell or other magic.</text>
      <text>A creature that isn't surprised can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If it does so, it can't see Veldyskar until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If it looks at Veldyskar in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.</text>

      <text>Xazax shoots three of the following magical eye rays at random (reroll duplicates), choosing one to three targets it can see within 120 feet of it:</text>
      <text>1. Charm Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by Xazax for 1 hour, or until Xazax harms the creature.</text>
      <text>2. Paralyzing Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</text>
      <text>3. Fear Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</text>
      <text>4. Slowing Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target's speed is halved for 1 minute. In addition, the creature can't take reactions, and it can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</text>
      <text>5. Enervation Ray. The targeted creature must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</text>
      <attack>Eye Rays||8d8</attack>
      <text>6. Telekinetic Ray. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or Xazax moves it up to 30 feet in any direction. It is restrained by the ray's telekinetic grip until the start of Xazax's next turn or until Xazax is incapacitated.</text>
      <text>If the target is an object weighing 300 pounds or less that isn't being worn or carried, it is moved up to 30 feet in any direction. Xazax can also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as manipulating a simple tool or opening a door or a container.</text>
      <text>7. Sleep Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or fall asleep and remain unconscious for 1 minute. The target awakens if it takes damage or another creature takes an action to wake it. This ray has no effect on constructs and undead.</text>
      <text>8. Petrification Ray. The targeted creature must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed by the  greater restoration spell or other magic.</text>
      <text>9. Disintegration Ray. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 45 (10d8) force damage. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, its body becomes a pile of fine gray dust.</text>
      <attack>Eye Rays||10d8</attack>
      <text>If the target is a Large or smaller nonmagical object or creation of magical force, it is disintegrated without a saving throw. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of magical force, this ray disintegrates a 10-foot cube of it.</text>
      <text>10. Death Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10) necrotic damage. The target dies if the ray reduces it to 0 hit points.</text>

        <text>When fighting inside its lair, a beholder can invoke the ambient magic to take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the beholder can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects:</text>
      <text>• A 50-foot-square area of ground within 120 feet of the beholder becomes slimy; that area is difficult terrain until initiative count 20 on the next round.</text>
      <text>• Walls within 120 feet of the beholder sprout grasping appendages until initiative count 20 on the round after next. Each creature of the beholder's choice that starts its turn within 10 feet of such a wall must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be grappled. Escaping requires a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.</text>
      <text>• An eye opens on a solid surface within 60 feet of the beholder. One random eye ray of the beholder shoots from that eye at a target of the beholder's choice that it can see. The eye then closes and disappears.</text>
      <text>The beholder can't repeat an effect until they have all been used, and it can't use the same effect two rounds in a row.</text>

      <text>• When the beholder sleeps, minor warps in reality occur within 1 mile of its lair and then vanish 24 hours later. Marks on cave walls might change subtly, an eerie trinket might appear where none existed before, harmless slime might coat a statue, and so on. These effects apply only to natural surfaces and to nonmagical objects that aren't on anyone's person.</text>
      <text>If the beholder dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.</text>

      <text>Yestabrod releases spores that burst out in a cloud that fills a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on it, and the cloud lingers for 1 minute. Any flesh-and-blood creature in the cloud when it appears, or that enters it later, must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the creature can't be infected by these spores for 24 hours. On a failed save, the creature is infected with a disease called the spores of Zuggtmoy and also gains a random form of indefinite madness (determined by rolling on the Madness of Zuggtmoy table in appendix D) that lasts until the creature is cured of the disease or dies. While infected in this way, the creature can't be reinfected, and it must be repeat the saving throw at the end of every 24 hours, ending the infection on a success. On a failure, the infected creature's body is slowly taken over by fungal growth, and after three such failed saves, the creature dies and is reanimated as a spore servant if it's a type of creature that can be (see the "Myconids" entry in the Monster Manual).</text>

      <text>If a creature starts its turn within 30 feet of the basilisk and the two of them can see each other, the basilisk can force the creature to make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw if the basilisk isn't incapacitated. On a failed save, the creature magically begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed by the  greater restoration spell or other magic.</text>
