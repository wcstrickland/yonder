In addition, it has no attack actions, though it can still cast its spells. The ahu-nixta s body can form eyes, mouths, and grabbing appendages. Its grabbing appendages can pick up objects and manipulate them, but the appendages can t be used for combat. The ahu-nixta s extra appendages can open and close glass-covered viewing ports in the clockwork armor, requiring no action, so it can see and interact with objects outside the armor.</text>

An ammut can only have one Medium or smaller creature swallowed at a time.</text>
      <text>If the ammut takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed creature, the ammut must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls prone in a space within 10 feet of the ammut.

    <trait>
        <name>Astral Devour</name>
      <text>A creature hosting an astral snapper's astral form must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw each time it finishes a long rest. On a success, the astral snapper is ejected from the host and the Astral Plane into an unoccupied space in the Material Plane within 10 feet of the host and is stunned for 1 round. On a failure, the astral snapper consumes part of the host's internal organs, reducing the host's Constitution score by 1d4. The host dies if this reduces its Constitution to 0. The reduction lasts until the host finishes a long rest after the astral snapper has been expelled. If the host's Constitution score is reduced to 0, the astral snapper exits the host's body in the Material Plane by tearing its way out through the abdomen. The astral snapper becomes completely corporeal as it exits the host, stepping out of the host at its full size.</text>
      <text>From the time the astral snapper succeeds on the initial dive into the host through the Astral Plane until the moment it emerges from the host's abdomen, it can be seen by any creature that can see into the Astral Planeits head buried in the host's back. The astral snapper has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and is effectively stunned when in this position until it takes damage.</text>

The astral snapper immediately passes through, closing the rift behind it. The target is then affected by the astral snapper's Astral Devour trait.</text>

        <name>Object Reading</name>
      <text>By concentrating for 10 minutes on a specific object, a corpse thief learns more about the object's most recent owner. The effects of this trait are different depending on if the most recent owner is alive or dead. This trait only works once per object.</text>
      <text>If the most recent owner is alive, the corpse thief sees through that person's eyes for 10 minutes. This works like the clairvoyance spell, except the most recent owner is the sensor and controls which direction it is pointed, how far it can see, etc. The most recent owner must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a success, it gets the sensation that it is being watched.</text>
      <text>If the most recent owner is dead, the corpse thief can learn five things about the person's life through dream-like visions and emotions. This works like the speak with dead spell, except the spirit can only answer questions about events in which the object was present.</text>

      <text>Whenever the crimson mist deals necrotic damage to a living creature with blood in its body, the creature's hp maximum is reduced by the same amount and the mist regains hp equal to half the necrotic damage dealt.</text>

        <name>Vampire Weaknesses</name>
      <text>The crimson mist has the following flaws.</text>
      <text>Forbiddance - The crimson mist can't enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants.</text>
      <text>Harmed by Running Water - The crimson mist takes 20 force damage if it ends its turn above or within running water.</text>
      <text>Sunlight Hypersensitivity - The crimson mist takes 20 radiant damage when it starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.</text>

    <action>
        <name>Engulf</name>
      <text>The mist moves up to its speed. While doing so, it can enter a Medium or smaller creature's space. When the mist enters a creature's space, the creature must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, the creature can choose to be pushed 5 feet back or to the side of the mist. A creature that chooses not to be pushed suffers the consequences of a failed saving throw.</text>
      <text>On a failed save, the mist enters the creature's space, and the creature takes 15 (4d6) necrotic damage and is engulfed. The engulfed creature can't breathe, is restrained, and takes 15 (4d6) necrotic damage at the start of each of the mist's turns. When the mist moves, the engulfed creature doesn't move with it, and is freed. An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an action to make a DC 14 Strength check. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the mist. A creature within 5 feet of the mist can take an action to pull a creature out of the mist. Doing so requires a DC 14 Strength check, and the creature making the attempt takes 14 (4d6) necrotic damage. The mist can only engulf one Medium or smaller creature at a time.</text>

If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed. A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the neophron, and it takes 14 (4d6) acid damage at the start of each of the neophron's turns.</text>

      <text>The neophron can only swallow one creature at a time. If a humanoid dies while swallowed, it transforms into a ghast. At the start of its next turn, the neophron regurgitates the ghast into an unoccupied space within 10 feet. The ghast is under the neophron's control and acts immediately after the neophron in the initiative count.</text>
      <text>If the neophron takes 20 or more damage in a single turn from a creature inside it, the neophron must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the swallowed creature, which falls prone in a space within 10 feet of the neophron. If the neophron dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape the corpse by using 5 feet of movement, exiting prone.</text>

      <text>One humanoid that the pishacha can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be possessed by the pishacha; the pishacha then disappears, and the target is incapacitated and loses some control of its body, succumbing to a random short-term madness (see the System Reference Document 5.1) each round for 3d6 rounds. At the end of the 3d6 rounds, the pishacha becomes dormant within the body.</text>
      <text>While possessing a victim, the pishacha attempts to seize control of the body again every 1d4 hours. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or succumb to another 3d6 round period of random short-term madness. Even if the target succeeds, it is still possessed. If the target is still possessed at the end of a long rest, it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or gain a long-term madness.</text>
      <text>While possessing a victim, the pishacha can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except those that can turn or repel fiends, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. It otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.</text>
      <text>The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hp, the pishacha ends it as a bonus action, or the pishacha is turned or forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. The pishacha can also be forced out if the victim eats a bowl of rice that has been cooked in holy water. When the possession ends, the pishacha reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body.</text>

      <text>The dragon is magically bound to three circlets. As long as the dragon is within 1 mile of a circlet wearer on the same plane of existence, the wearer can communicate telepathically with the dragon. While the dragon is active, the wearers see through its eyes and hear what it hears. During this time, the wearers are deaf and blind with regard to their own senses.</text>
      <text>If only two circlet wearers are within 1 mile of the active dragon, each hour spent wearing the circlets imposes one level of exhaustion on those wearers. If only a single wearer is within 1 mile of the active dragon, each minute spent wearing the circlet gives that wearer one level of exhaustion. If no circlet wearers are within 1 mile of the dragon, it views all creatures it can see as enemies and tries to destroy them until a circlet wearer communicates with the dragon or the dragon is destroyed. A circlet wearer can use its action to put the dragon in an inactive state where it becomes incapacitated until a wearer uses an action to switch the dragon to active.</text>

        <name>Berserk</name>
      <text>Whenever the bone golem starts its turn with 30 hp or fewer, roll a d6. On a 6, the golem goes berserk. On each of its turns while berserk, the golem attacks the nearest creature it can see. If no creature is near enough to move to and attack, the golem attacks an object, usually an object smaller than itself.</text>
      <text>Once the golem goes berserk, it continues to attack until it is destroyed or it regains all its hp.</text>
      <text>The golem's creator, if within 60 feet of the berserk golem, can calm it by speaking firmly and persuasively. The golem must be able to hear its creator, who must take an action to make a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check. If the check succeeds, the golem ceases being berserk. If it takes damage while still at 30 hp or fewer, the golem might go berserk again.</text>

        <name>Aura Of Immobility</name>
      <text>The herald of the great wyrm emits an area of antimagic within 60 feet of itself. This trait works like the antimagic field spell, except it only affects magical travel.</text>
      <text>At the start of each of its turns, the herald chooses whether this aura is active. The aura prevents the herald's own magical traveling.</text>

        <name>Hidden Herald</name>
      <text>The herald of the great wyrm can use its action to polymorph into a Medium dragonborn, Medium human, Small kobold, or back into its true draconic humanoid form.</text>
      <text>In each form, its eyes glow with a magical light that shifts in color and it wears a silver key, revealing its identity as a herald.</text>
      <text>Its statistics, other than its size, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying, other than the silver key, transforms with it. It reverts to its true form if it dies.</text>

      <text>As a bonus action, the herald of the great wyrm can open any object that contains a mundane or magical means that prevents access. This trait works like the knock spell, except it dispels rather than suppresses arcane lock and it doesn't create an audible knock when used. Alternatively, the herald can use a bonus action to open or close any magical portal, road, gateway, or path.</text>

A creature, including the target, can take an action to make a DC 17 Strength check, ending the restrained condition on a success. The herald can restrain only two creatures at a time in this way.</text>

        <name>Black Well of Unmaking (Cost 2 Actions)</name>
      <text>The herald of the great wyrm creates a 5-foot-sphere of void matter on a point it can see within 120 feet of it. At the start of each of the herald's turns, each creature other than the herald within 30 feet of the well of unmaking must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 15 feet toward the well. Each creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the well must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 27 (6d8) necrotic damage and is stunned. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't stunned. The well of unmaking lasts until the herald uses this legendary action again or until the herald dies.</text>

      <text>Those who fail a saving throw against the horned serpent's Gem Gaze or bite attack become infected with the corpse cough disease. The infected creature can't benefit from short or long rests due to a constant, wet cough. The infected creature must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw each day or take 18 (4d8) necrotic damage. The target's hp maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. The target dies if this effect reduces its hp maximum to 0. The reduction lasts until the target is cured of the disease with a greater restoration spell or similar magic. If the infected creature comes into physical contact with a blood relative before the disease is cured, the relative must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or also become infected with the disease. The blood relative is afflicted with a constant, wet cough within hours of infection, but the disease's full effects don't manifest until 1d4 days later. Corpse cough is so named due to the smell of the cough as the infected creature's lungs become necrotic.</text>

      <text>The jinmenju emits a puff of purple gas around its roots. Each creature within 10 feet of an exposed root must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or fall prone with laughter, becoming incapacitated and unable to stand up until the end of its next turn. A creature in an area of overlapping gas only makes the saving throw once. A creature with an Intelligence score of 4 or less isn't affected.</text>

    <trait>
        <name>Necrotic Regeneration</name>
      <text>While attached to a living host, a necrotic tick leaks negative energy into the host's bloodstream, quickly closing over the creature's wounds with scabrous, necrotic flesh. If the host doesn't already have regeneration, it regains 2 hp at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point.</text>
      <text>Track how many "necrotic hp" a host recovers via Necrotic Regeneration. Magical healing reverses the necrosis and subtracts an equal number of necrotic hp from those accumulated.</text>
      <text>When the necrotic hp equal the host's hit point maximum, the host becomes a zombie.</text>
      </trait>
    <trait>
        <name>Ride Host</name>
      <text>When a necrotic tick's living host has lost three-quarters of its maximum hp from Blood Drain, the tick's toxins fill the host with an unnatural desire to approach other living beings.</text>
      <text>When a suitable creature is within 5 feet, the tick incites a sudden rage in the host, riding the current host to a new host. The current host must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or it attempts to grapple a living creature within 5 feet of it as a reaction. The host can re-attempt this saving throw at the end of each turn that it suffers damage from the necrotic tick's Blood Drain.</text>
      </trait>
    <action>
        <name>Blood Drain</name>
      <text>Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. 1 piercing damage, and the tick attaches to the target. While attached, the necrotic tick doesn't attack. Instead, at the start of each of the tick's turns, the target loses 5 (1d4 + 3) hp due to blood loss. The target must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, it is affected by the tick's toxins and doesn't attempt to remove the tick. The host will even replace a dislodged tick unless prevented from doing so for 1 minute, after which the tick's influence fades.</text>
      <text>The tick can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement.</text>
      <text>It does so when seeking a new host or if the target dies. A creature, including the target, can use its action to detach the tick. When a necrotic tick detaches, voluntarily or otherwise, its host takes 1 necrotic damage.</text>

The dark silence lasts as long as the nian maintains concentration, up to 10 minutes (as if concentrating on a spell). The nian sees objects in the sphere in shades of gray. Darkvision can't penetrate the darkness, no natural light can illuminate it, no sound can be created within or pass through it, and any creature or object entirely inside the sphere of dark silence is immune to thunder damage. Creatures entirely inside the darkness are deafened and can't cast spells that include a verbal component. If any of the darkness overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell creating the light is destroyed.</text>

The spirit lamp can only see objects within the lantern's light and is blind while the lantern is closed.

      <text>The spirit lamp's lantern is immune to damage and can't be the target of spells or effects as long as the spirit lamp lives. When the spirit lamp dies, the lantern floats gently to the ground and opens, if it was closed. The lantern has AC 17, 50 hp, and is immune to piercing, poison, and psychic damage. A creature that touches the lantern must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be cursed. A cursed creature is frightened of darkness, can't see anything outside of the lantern's light, and is unable to drop the lantern. The cursed creature will risk its own life to protect the lantern. A creature can repeat the saving throw each day at dawn, lifting the curse and ending the effects on itself on a success. If this occurs, the lantern disintegrates. After three failed saving throws, remove curse or similar magic is required to end the curse.</text>
      <text>If the creature remains cursed after 30 days, it is irreversibly changed by the curse, and it becomes the lantern's new spirit lamp. Voluntarily opening the lantern counts as a failed saving throw. If the lantern is destroyed, all captured spirits are put to rest and the cursed bearer, if it has not yet changed into a spirit lamp, is freed of the curse.</text>

      <text>When a creature that can see the sunset raptor's tail starts its turn within 100 feet of the raptor, the raptor can force it to make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw if the raptor isn't incapacitated and can see the creature. On a failure, a creature becomes charmed until the start of its next turn.</text>
      <text>While charmed, the creature is incapacitated as it suffers from surreal hallucinations and must move up to its speed closer to the raptor that charmed it. It doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the sunset raptor, a target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Other sunset raptors are immune to this effect.</text>
      <text>Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see the sunset raptor until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again.

This movement must be completed between two portions of solid ground within two turns (with Dash actions, a red queen bird can move up to 200 feet over empty space).

The effect also ends if the creature takes any damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it out of its stupor.</text>

      <text>A powerful strain of vampirism, shroud-eaters have a greater degree of free will from their sires, though they are bound by what is called the "Tree of Chains," a pyramid of control with a free-willed vampire at the summit and all those beneath it compelled to obedience. They cannot plot against or defy their sires, but otherwise they can create their own shroud-eaters beholden to them. Wise vampire hunters know to employ the speak with dead spell on a slain shroud-eater to discover its sire, following the Tree of Chains as far as they are able.</text>

    <action>
        <name>Misleading Lore</name>
      <text>Shroud-eaters can tolerate quite a bit of sunlight, and, as they grow older, they may withstand it for a longer time, though they still suffer from it and rarely venture out in the day unless forced to do so. Over time, shroud-eaters also learn to alter the memories of the living and to erase traces of their deeds from the minds of witnesses. A subtle shroud-eater may go undetected for ages.</text>

    <action>
        <name>Signs of Their Presence</name>
      <text>Unlike other vampires, shroud-eaters cannot be destroyed with a simple wooden stake. The stake must use wood of a white oak or white ash tree. Discovery of burnt groves of these trees serves as a sign that a shroud-eater may live in the area.</text>

The weirding scroll can have only one humanoid under its control at one time. If it dominates another, the effect on the previous target ends.</text>

They also maintain a presence on the Rothenian Plain, both in caves under Demon Mountain by permission of its Master and in the forests north of the plain. When using the Midgard setting, change the doomspeaker's spells to the following (see "Fifth Edition Appendix" in the Midgard Worldbook)</text>
      <text>1st level (4 slots): bane, bloody smite, doom of the cracked shield, memento mori
