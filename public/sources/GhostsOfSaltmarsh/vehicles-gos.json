If the characters are guests on a galley, the crew consists of the following creatures, all of which have proficiency with water vehicles in addition to their normal statistics:\n\u2022 One captain (bandit captain)\n\u2022 Five other officers: a first mate, a bosun, a quartermaster, a surgeon, and a cook (scout)\n\u2022 Forty-two sailors (commoner)\n\u2022 Twelve siege engineers (guard)\n\u2022 Twenty guard\nMain Deck\nThe main deck of the galley has the following features:\n\u2022 Ballistas. Four ballistas (DMG, ch. 8) are attached to the fore of the deck. Ten ballista arrows are stacked and secured near each.\n\u2022 Mangonels. Two mangonels (DMG, ch. 8) are attached to the aft of the deck. Ten mangonel stones are stacked and secured near each catapult.\n\u2022 Naval Ram. The galley's stern features an iron naval ram used for attacking other ships.\n\u2022 Opening. A 10-foot-wide, 80-foot-long open space in the middle of the deck stretches fore to aft and leads down to the lower deck.\n\u2022 Railing. A 3-foot-high rail is built around the deck's perimeter, providing half cover for Medium creatures and three-quarters cover for Small creatures behind it.\n\u2022 Rowboats. Eight rowboats are stacked in two groups of four on this deck. Ropes and pulleys can hoist these boats in and out of the water.\n\u2022 Timpani. A timpani with two attached mallets sits on the aft of the main deck just before the opening to the lower deck. A crew member plays this instrument while the sailors on the lower deck row, the beat helping to synchronize the rowers' strokes.\n\u2022 Wheel. The ship's wheel stands at the aft of the deck.\nLower Deck\nThe cramped lower deck of the galley ship reeks of body odor and has the following features:\n\u2022 Cargo Holds. Cargo holds at the fore and aft of the lower deck hold crates, barrels, and ammunition secured with rope.\n\u2022 Oars. Thirty-two benches are built into the deck, each with a 20-foot-long oar. When the ship is rowed, crew members sit on these benches to work the oars. Ten spare oars hang on the walls.\nSource: Ghosts of Saltmarsh p. 187",

                "description": "Example Crew\nA warship requires a large crew to properly sail the vessel. Warships carry extra soldiers to fight battles and fire the siege weapons. If the characters are guests on a warship, the crew consists of the following creatures, all of which have proficiency with water vehicles in addition to their normal statistics:\n\u2022 One captain (bandit captain)\n\u2022 Four other officers: a first mate, a bosun, a quartermaster, and a cook (noble)\n\u2022 Twenty-five sailors (commoner)\nA warship typically includes the following additional crew to augment its fighting ability:\n\u2022 Forty soldiers (guard)\n\u2022 Eight siege engineers (guard)\n\u2022 One priest (the ship's surgeon)\n1. Main Deck\nThe main deck of the ship has the following features:\n\u2022 Mangonel. Sailing ships have one mangonel (DMG, ch. 8) attached to the deck. Warships have two mangonels (DMG, ch. 8). Each weapon has 10 mangonel stones stacked and secured near it.\n\u2022 Hatch. A covered, 10-foot-square opening leads to the lower deck (area W8).\n\u2022 Railing. The main deck has a 3-foot-high rail around its perimeter that provides half cover for Medium creatures and three-quarters cover for Small creatures behind it.\n\u2022 Rowboats. Four rowboat are stacked on top of each other on this deck. Ropes and pulleys can hoist these boats in and out of the water.\n2. Officers' Quarters\nFour beds stand in the officer's quarters. Beneath each is an iron footlocker that holds the officers' belongings. The officers sleep in shifts so someone remains on duty to command the crew and carry out the captain's orders.\n3. Captain's Quarters\nThe captain's quarters hold a bed and a desk. Beneath the bed is an iron footlocker that holds the captain's belongings.\n4. Siege Weapon Ammunition\nShelves and rope on the walls of this cabin secure mangonel stones and ballista arrows.\n5. Supplies\nThis area holds tools, barrels of tar, rope, extra material to repair sails, and other supplies needed to maintain the ship.\n6. Forecastle\nThe forecastle has the following features:\n\u2022 Ballista. A ballista (DMG, ch. 8) is attached to the deck. Ten ballista arrows are stacked and secured nearby.\n\u2022 Figurehead. Warships have an iron figurehead at the front of their forecastle, often shaped to look like a fearsome sea predator. This figurehead serves as the ship's naval ram.\n\u2022 Railing. The forecastle has a 3-foot-high rail around its perimeter that provides half cover for Medium creatures and three-quarters cover for Small creatures behind it.\n7. Quarterdeck\nThe quarterdeck has the following features:\n\u2022 Ballista. On a warship, a ballista (DMG, ch. 8) is attached to the deck. Ten ballista arrows are stacked and secured nearby.\n\u2022 Railing.

The ship's wheel stands at the aft of the quarterdeck.\n8. Oar Deck\nTwenty-two benches are built into the deck of the lower deck, each with a 20-foot-long oar. When the ship is rowed, crew members sit on these benches to work the oars. Ten spare oars hang on the walls of the ship.\n9. Privy\nBenches line the walls of this room. Four holes carved in them house chamber pots.\n10. Medical Cabin\nHooks and shelves on the walls hold medical instruments, bandages, balms, tonics, jars of leeches, and more, ready to treat injuries from combat or sailing mishaps.\n11. Brig\nThis cabin is meant for guests and visiting high-ranking officials along for the journey. Since warships often have a greater need to house prisoners rather than guests, each bed aboard such a vessel also has a set of manacles (see chapter 5 in the Player's Handbook) attached to its frame.\n12. Hold\nThis area houses both passengers and cargo. The ship's off-duty crew sleep on bedrolls among the crates and barrels of food, water, and other supplies.\n13. Armory\nThe ship's supply of weapons and armor is held in this cabin. Its walls are fitted with built-in weapon and armor racks. The door to this cabin is usually locked, the key kept by one of the ship's officers.\nSource: Ghosts of Saltmarsh p. 194",
