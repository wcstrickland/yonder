                "description": "Roleplaying Auril\nPortraying a deity, even a lesser god such as Auril the Frostmaiden, can be daunting. For roleplaying purposes, the following suggestions might prove helpful:\n\u2022 So long as she has mortal worshipers, Auril can't truly die (although the characters can rid the world of her for a time). Thus, she has no reason to capitulate to mortals' demands. As the embodiment of winter's cruelty, she is incapable of showing mercy or compassion. Play her as a supremely cold and unfeeling entity.\n\u2022 Have Auril speak only when necessary. The less she talks, the less risk you have of unintentionally demystifying her in the eyes of your players. Let her actions, not her words, define her.\n\u2022 Lesser gods in the D&D multiverse are extremely powerful and arrogant, but also fallible and blind to their own flaws. It's appropriate for Auril to act as though she's invincible while underestimating her mortal enemies, even in her current weakened state.\nLair Actions\nAuril dwells on Solstice, a frozen island hidden among the titanic icebergs in the Sea of Moving Ice. Few creatures know of this island, let alone how to reach it. See chapter 5 for information about the regional effects that encompass the island.\nWhile she's on the island, the Frostmaiden can take one of the following lair actions on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties):\n\u2022 Auril instantly knows the locations and health of all other creatures on the island. She knows how much damage each of these creatures has taken, how many levels of exhaustion they have, and what conditions are affecting them currently.\n\u2022 Auril instantly teleports to any location on the island. If the space she chooses as her destination is already occupied, Auril appears in the closest unoccupied space to it instead.\n\u2022 Auril telepathically communicates with any number of creatures at once, provided they're all on the island. This effect lasts until Auril stops concentrating on it (as if concentrating on a spell) or until she leaves the island or uses a different lair action.\nAuril's Three Forms\nIn her current weakened state, Auril can assume three different forms. To destroy her, heroes must reduce each of her forms to 0 hit points one after another. After she's defeated in her third and final form, Auril dies. As long as she has mortal followers who worship her, however, Auril is reborn at full strength during the next winter solstice, with divine power far beyond what is reflected in the stat blocks presented here.\nAfter finishing a long rest, Auril regains any of her forms that were destroyed, provided at least one form survives. When she transitions from one form to another, she loses all the traits and actions of the old form and gains those of the new form.\nA stat block is given for each of Auril's three forms. These descriptions do not reflect Auril at full power, but rather Auril as she is encountered in this adventure.\nSource: Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden p. 275",

                "description": "Roleplaying Auril\nPortraying a deity, even a lesser god such as Auril the Frostmaiden, can be daunting. For roleplaying purposes, the following suggestions might prove helpful:\n\u2022 So long as she has mortal worshipers, Auril can't truly die (although the characters can rid the world of her for a time). Thus, she has no reason to capitulate to mortals' demands. As the embodiment of winter's cruelty, she is incapable of showing mercy or compassion. Play her as a supremely cold and unfeeling entity.\n\u2022 Have Auril speak only when necessary. The less she talks, the less risk you have of unintentionally demystifying her in the eyes of your players. Let her actions, not her words, define her.\n\u2022 Lesser gods in the D&D multiverse are extremely powerful and arrogant, but also fallible and blind to their own flaws. It's appropriate for Auril to act as though she's invincible while underestimating her mortal enemies, even in her current weakened state.\nLair Actions\nAuril dwells on Solstice, a frozen island hidden among the titanic icebergs in the Sea of Moving Ice. Few creatures know of this island, let alone how to reach it. See chapter 5 for information about the regional effects that encompass the island.\nWhile she's on the island, the Frostmaiden can take one of the following lair actions on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties):\n\u2022 Auril instantly knows the locations and health of all other creatures on the island. She knows how much damage each of these creatures has taken, how many levels of exhaustion they have, and what conditions are affecting them currently.\n\u2022 Auril instantly teleports to any location on the island. If the space she chooses as her destination is already occupied, Auril appears in the closest unoccupied space to it instead.\n\u2022 Auril telepathically communicates with any number of creatures at once, provided they're all on the island. This effect lasts until Auril stops concentrating on it (as if concentrating on a spell) or until she leaves the island or uses a different lair action.\nAuril's Three Forms\nIn her current weakened state, Auril can assume three different forms. To destroy her, heroes must reduce each of her forms to 0 hit points one after another. After she's defeated in her third and final form, Auril dies. As long as she has mortal followers who worship her, however, Auril is reborn at full strength during the next winter solstice, with divine power far beyond what is reflected in the stat blocks presented here.\nAfter finishing a long rest, Auril regains any of her forms that were destroyed, provided at least one form survives. When she transitions from one form to another, she loses all the traits and actions of the old form and gains those of the new form.\nA stat block is given for each of Auril's three forms. These descriptions do not reflect Auril at full power, but rather Auril as she is encountered in this adventure.\nSource: Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden p. 277",

She likes using her magic to destroy things, and her hunger for magic items knows no bounds. Her supreme confidence means that she never backs down from a challenge, even when the odds are clearly stacked against her. Seeing other wizards as a threat, paranoia rules her life.\nAvarice has been a member of the Arcane Brotherhood for almost two years. She fantasizes about rising to fame and prominence in record time and hopes that plundering the lost Netherese city of Ythryn will turn her fantasies into reality.\nThe tiefling has the secret support of the archdevil Levistus, having traded her soul years ago for her first taste of magical power. Levistus speaks to her in dreams and guides her path. Shortly after Avarice arrived in Ten-Towns, Levistus urged her to seek out the Black Sword. Avarice didn't know who or what the Black Sword was until she was approached by cultists of Levistus bearing swordlike shards of chardalyn worn as pendants around their necks. These self-styled Knights of the Black Sword offered her sanctuary in the keep of Caer-Dineval, where they are based. Although she doesn't trust the cultists, they treat her with more respect than anyone else does, and the keep is a safer location than most other places in Ten-Towns.\nCompanions. Avarice has a pair of loyal Gargoyle named Gargle and Gurgle who serve her as bodyguards and scouts. Avarice uses her Rary's telepathic bond spell to stay in telepathic contact with her gargoyles before sending them off on any mission. Avarice also has the support of the Knights of the Black Sword, if she needs to call on their talents.\nFamiliar. Avarice's familiar throughout the adventure is a squawking raven named Skelm. It uses the raven stat block in the Monster Manual but is a fiend instead of a beast.\nSpellbook. Avarice's spellbook has white leather covers and vellum pages. The tiefling's personal sigil is burned into the front cover. The book contains the spells Avarice has prepared plus the following additional spells: burning hands, cone of cold, find familiar, ice storm, lightning bolt, rope trick, thunderwave, tongues, wall of fire, and wall of force.\nSource: Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden p. 269",

From what the hunters have seen, their prey is smarter than the average moose, and its white hide makes it hard to spot in the snow.

The transformation renders the brain immortal and imbues it with psionic power, so that it can spend eternity plotting and executing its desires.\nA brain in a jar can speak without vocal cords, psionically projecting its disembodied voice outward for all to hear. It enjoys conversation so much that it is prone to talking for hours on end, sometimes to itself if there are no others with whom it can speak. It also likes to think out loud and reflect on the events and decisions that led to its great transformation.\nBeing divorced from one's body can tax the mind, and the longer a brain in a jar exists, the more likely some form of insanity will take hold of it. A brain in a jar is particularly susceptible to dementia, schizophrenia, and paranoia.\nImmortal Vessels. The brain floats in a jar of solution, pulsating as it reacts to its surroundings. Some brains have been known to thump against the walls of their containers when excited or vexed. A jar's metal casing might be rusty but serviceable, or an elegantly wrought masterwork, depending on its creator. A brain in a jar weighs roughly 125 pounds.\nSource: Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden p. 278",

This alignment change can be undone by any magic that ends a curse, but after ten days, it can be reversed only by a wish spell or divine intervention.\nA creature wounded by one of these chardalyn weapons can feel a sudden sickness creep over them, but it passes quickly.\nChardalyn Madness. Prolonged contact with the demonic magic imprinted on the chardalyn has afflicted the berserker with a form of madness, causing the berserker to believe that its weapons are conduits through which it can speak to a demon lord or other dark power, as well as channel its rage. If the berserker's madness is cured using magic that removes the effects of madness, the berserker loses its Chardalyn Madness trait but retains its chaotic evil alignment and other qualities. Further exposure to the demonic magic causes the berserker's madness to return, however.\nSource: Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden p. 280",

The leaders of the Arcane Brotherhood welcomed him with open arms, eager to count a Red Wizard among their ranks. Dzaan might have become a force to reckon with in the brotherhood had his quest for power not led him to Icewind Dale, where he was killed by the people of Easthaven after making a few too many enemies.\nDzaan's Demise. Dzaan's trouble started after he broke away from his fellow wizards and hired adventurers to scour Icewind Dale for Netherese ruins. One group of them uncovered a buried tower in the tundra (see \"Lost Spire of Netheril\"), and Dzaan went out of his way to eliminate anyone who knew of it, including the adventurers who found it and several Ten-Towners with whom they had spoken. After turning the tower into his secret base, Dzaan visited Easthaven to gather supplies. Although he took the precaution of adopting a magical disguise, members of the local militia recognized Dzaan by the way he walked and spoke. They captured him, gagged him, confiscated his spellbook, and condemned him to death.\nThe characters have no opportunity to speak with Dzaan. They first encounter him in Easthaven, tied to a stake and engulfed in flames (see \"Toil and Trouble\"). The Ten-Towners enjoy the execution while it lasts. After warming themselves by the fire, they leave Dzaan's ashes to be scattered by the wind.\nDzaan's Simulacrum. Unbeknownst to his executioners, Dzaan had used a spell scroll of simulacrum to create a copy of himself. This simulacrum dwells in the sunken Netherese spire, waiting for its creator to return.\nThe simulacrum, which looks and acts like Dzaan, has half of Dzaan's hit points and can't regain expended spell slots. It has wasted its 3rd-level spell slots trying to reach Dzaan with sending spells, to no avail, and has expended other spell slots to help it survive the perils of the spire. It uses its remaining spell slots sparingly.\nThe sunken Netherese tower contains a special room that can transform the simulacrum into a real person\u2014or any magical illusion into the real thing, for that matter. If this change occurs, the simulacrum effectively becomes a Dzaan, authentic in every way. Dzaan's stat block and abilities change as follows:\n\u2022 He has spell slots appropriate for a 9th-level wizard (four 1st-level spell slots, three 2nd- through 4th-level spell slots, and one 5th-level spell slot), but he lacks a spellbook and therefore can't change his list of prepared spells.\n\u2022 If he finishes a long rest, he has the following additional spell slots, which allow him to cast the indicated spells: 3rd level (3 slots): fireball, sending, slow 4th level (3 slots): arcane eye, confusion 5th level (1 slot): animate objects\n\u2022 His hit point maximum becomes 49 (9d8 + 9), and his challenge rating becomes 2 (450 XP). His challenge rating becomes 4 (1,100 XP) if he finishes a long rest and regains his expended spells.\nCompanion. Because they're so despised throughout Faer\u00fbn, Red Wizards often adopt disguises and rarely travel abroad without an escort. They generally favor undead servants and bodyguards, since they find that undead tend to be more obedient than the living. Dzaan's bodyguard is a Thayan wight named Krintaas. When Dzaan returned to Easthaven, he ordered his companion to stay with the simulacrum and watch over it and the buried Netherese spire.\nSource: Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden p. 270",

They seek to preserve the arctic wilderness by destroying outsiders who cross their path. Each patrols its territory in the guise of an arctic fox, a mountain goat, a snowy owl, or a wolf, reverting to human form only when it attacks. Clever ambushers, they use hallucinatory terrain spells to create illusory snowdrifts under which they can hide, or to obscure pools covered by thin ice through which others might fall.\nAwakened Companions. A frost druid is often accompanied by one or more beasts, shrubs, or evergreen trees that it has made sentient using the awaken spell. These druids favor polar bears and reindeer (use the elk stat block in the Monster Manual) as companions, and such creatures typically share the druid's disposition.\nIce Sickle. A frost druid can carve a sickle out of ice, requiring a total of 24 hours for the work. Bitter cold courses through this weapon while it's in the druid's hands. If the druid dies, the ice sickle melts away. The weapon is otherwise identical to a normal sickle.\nSource: Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden p. 288",

It cackles maniacally when it catches the scent of its prey and quickly moves in for the kill, tearing away flesh with its claws, gorging on meat and blood, and leaving nothing behind but bones, gristle, and the victim's blood-spattered belongings.\nGnoll vampires are indiscriminate feeders that prefer the flesh and blood of humanoids, including other gnolls. Their noses can't stand the scent of perfumes, and their ears can't abide words spoken aloud in Celestial. They don't cast reflections in mirrors unless they want to.\nUnlike normal vampires, gnoll vampires don't have coffins where they rest, and they have no such places to return to when their corporeal bodies are destroyed. They are undeterred by running water, and they can enter residences without invitation. When a gnoll vampire needs to travel quickly, it adopts the form of a giant, emaciated hyena. When it wants to catch its prey by surprise, it takes the form of a cloud of mist. After it feeds on a victim's blood, its mist form takes on a crimson hue for an hour or so before its colorlessness returns.\nTekeli-Li and the Caves of Hunger. \n------\nTekeli-li was a Gnoll Fang of Yeenoghu, a powerful gnoll whose pack invaded Icewind Dale more than a century ago. When the gnolls' wanton slaughter of reindeer herds threatened the survival of the Reghed tribes, the tribes banded together against the gnolls and routed them in the autumn of 1333 DR. Tekeli-li and his surviving kin fled across the tundra with the Reghed tribes in pursuit.\nThe wounded gnolls found an icy cleft on the edge of the Reghed Glacier and hid there for the winter. To keep their leader alive, the other gnolls allowed Tekeli-li to eat them one by one, yet his hunger would not abate. Auril came upon the starving, half-frozen creature and flung Tekeli-li into an icy tomb deep within the glacier. In doing so, the Frostmaiden sought to preserve what the gnoll had become\u2014the embodiment of winter's remorseless consumption.\nTekeli-li exists today as a gnoll vampire that hasn't fed in decades. Adventurers who use the \"Rime of the Frostmaiden\" to create a passage through the glacier unknowingly release the starving gnoll vampire from its icy sepulcher. For more information about Tekeli-li's lair, the Caves of Hunger, see chapter 6.\n------\nSource: Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden p. 290",

After about seven days in its new home, the tadpole transforms its host into a mind flayer. The new creation typically retains no memory of its previous existence.\nFor reasons unknown, ceremorphosis can go awry when an illithid tadpole is implanted in the brain of a gnome. This deviation might be due to the quasi-magical nature of gnomes, or simply a facet of how their minds work. When the process is warped only slightly, the mind flayer remains gnome-sized and is called a gnome ceremorph. It retains its knowledge of the Gnomish language while becoming able to speak Deep Speech and Undercommon. It retains fragmented memories of its previous life and previous alignment, not to mention a propensity for invention.\nLaser Pistol. A gnome ceremorph often carries a home-built device that functions as a laser pistol (see \"Firearms\" in the Dungeon Master's Guide). This weapon is powered by an energy cell, which enables the weapon to fire 50 shots. After its last shot is expended, the device becomes inoperable. The energy cell can't be removed without destroying the weapon.\nSource: Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden p. 303",

She can take the form of either a polar bear or a hulking, bipedal shape obscured by wind and blowing snow. Elders invoke her name to keep young goliaths from wandering too far from home before they're ready. Adult goliaths sometimes encounter this legendary individual in their travels to the far-flung corners of the dale. If they flee like cowards, Oyaminartok laughs and lets them go to wander in obscurity. If they challenge Oyaminartok to a fight, the Winter Walker smiles and tests their mettle. Those who impress her with their fighting skills are bitten and become goliath werebears themselves\u2014goliaths who carry Oyaminartok's curse of lycanthropy. Contrary to myth, Oyaminartok is not a monster but a force of good in the region, and she passes her curse only to goliaths whose hearts are pure.\nOyaminartok and others of her kind try to help creatures they come across, for the weather and the geography of Icewind Dale can be brutal. They know the safest routes across the tundra, and they can help guide travelers through the Sea of Moving Ice and across its ever-shifting ice floes. These polar werebears attack evil in the wilderness, but they steer clear of camps and settlements. Fire is Oyaminartok's bane, and thus she and her kind are wary around hearths and open flames.\nSource: Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden p. 293",

The Muzgardts are based in Gracklstugh, a duergar city in the Underdark. They mass-produce and distribute a filthy duergar ale made from mushrooms. Xardorok has been eager to take a fourth wife and has had his eye on Grandolpha Muzgardt for many years. He asked Grandolpha to his fortress to give her a gift\u2014a pseudodragon made of chardalyn (a pseudo-pseudodragon, if you will)\u2014and make her an offer she can't refuse. Once he conquers Icewind Dale, he wants the Muzgardts to control the ale trade throughout his sunless surface kingdom.\nGrandolpha, for her part, is too canny and jaded to fall for Xardorok's blunt attempt at seduction. She has begun plotting with disenfranchised advisors and warriors in his ranks to overthrow him when the moment is right. Ironically, despite his paranoia, Xardorok is too blinded by his admiration for Grandolpha to foresee her treachery.\nBefore entering combat, Grandolpha casts stoneskin on herself. Once her guards come to her rescue, she withdraws from combat and uses her faerie fire spell to make enemies easier for her guards to hit. The chardalyn pseudodragon defends Grandolpha to the death.\nSource: Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden p. 176",

He hunts Ten-Towners for sport, bathes in their blood, and strikes fear into the hearts of his enemies. Several members of Isarr's clan have deserted him or been killed off, but the few that remain are fiercely loyal. They believe, incorrectly, that he's the Chosen of Malar.\nAlthough Isarr calls himself the Wolf King, few others in the Wolf Tribe support him in that claim, but the other Wolf clan chieftains are too weak and disorganized to challenge him.\nSource: Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden p. 307",

He has led the Elk Tribe for over half his life, and age has made him cautious. He has seen other kings and queens rise and fall, has made war with friends and peace with his enemies, and has led warriors he knew as babes to their deaths in battle. The strain of his long years of rule is etched on his weather-worn face.\nJarund's late son, Jarund Twice-Born, was killed almost a decade ago while trying to bring down a cave bear, leaving Jarund without an heir. He has failed to produce another child with his wife, Wynneth, and his mistress, Froya, so the future of his royal line remains uncertain.\nAuril's unyielding winter concerns Jarund deeply, and he often turns to his shaman, Mjenir, for guidance. The king respects the shaman's understanding of gods and spirits, and the fact that both men have lost their sons serves to strengthen the bond between them. Mjenir believes that the only way to break Auril's spell is to slay the goddess in her home, but Jarund believes that his warriors aren't strong enough to accomplish that task alone.\nSource: Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden p. 305",

He rules the roost by sheer force of personality, though it chafes him that Hethyl Arkorran has more respect and influence within the cult. Kadroth doesn't involve Avarice in cult affairs because he fears her spellcasting ability and her connection to the Arcane Brotherhood. She could take over the cult anytime she wanted, and Kadroth doesn't want to give her any reason to do so.\nFor all his political machinations, Kadroth is a visionary who has so far made the cult stronger through his actions and decisions. He spends hours behind his desk, staring into the burning fireplace and drawing inspiration from its crackling flames. The slightest disturbance upsets him.\nKadroth appreciates the wisdom of maintaining the illusion that Speaker Crannoc Siever is still in charge, if only to keep Caer-Dineval's townsfolk from becoming restless. Thus, when necessary, Kadroth has the town speaker brought to his office to sign official documents.\nSource: Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden p. 42",

Nass and Zelenn's relationship started off well, but in recent years it has become painfully obvious to Zelenn that Nass has been slow to master the arcane tradition of divination. Zelenn's suggestion that Nass leave the Hosttower of the Arcane and gain experience abroad left Nass feeling unwanted. After much thought, however, Nass came around to the idea. She could put her magic to the test and carve out a name for herself.\nAs she was preparing to leave the Hosttower, Nass overheard her master talking to another wizard about a covert expedition to Icewind Dale being undertaken to seek out long-lost magic from a bygone empire. Rather than carry out her original plan, Nass followed her fellow wizards to Icewind Dale. She caught up to them in Bryn Shander and made her presence known, claiming she was sent by her master to aid the expedition with her divinations. Egos and frayed nerves caused the group to split up shortly thereafter, with each wizard determined to succeed alone.\nOne night while the others slept, Nass stole a Professor Skant (see appendix D) from one of her fellow wizards, Vellynne Harpell. Two of Vellynne's kobold companions witnessed the theft, and Nass killed them with Melf's acid arrow spells before fleeing with the orb.\nNass fled Ten-Towns and headed toward the Sea of Moving Ice, hoping to find a tome called The Codicil of White, a book of magic and lore composed by servants of Auril the Frostmaiden. The Arcane Brotherhood believes that this book tells how to reach a lost city of magic entombed in the ice. Before she could obtain the book, Nass perished. She now exists as a ghost, unable to rest until she finds the book. Characters who come upon Nass's frozen remains also find her spellbook and the orb she stole from Vellynne.\nFamiliar. Nass's magical familiar, a white arctic weasel acclimated to cold weather named Zelennor, watches over the wizard's frozen remains. It uses the weasel stat block in the Monster Manual but is a fey instead of a beast. If Zelennor is reduced to 0 hit points, Nass's ghost is unable to cast the find familiar spell in order to get it back.\nSpellcasting. As a ghost, Nass can cast the spells she prepared prior to her death\u2014except that the ghost can't cast spells that require material components, which limits its options. Its list of prepared spells shows only those spells it can cast. Although it has no 2nd-level spells available, the ghost can use its 2nd-level spell slots to cast upgraded versions of the thunderwave spell.\nSpellbook. The wooden covers of Nass's spellbook are bound in nothic hide, and silver clasps hold the book shut. Nass's personal sigil is inscribed on the spine, which also bears the title Lantomir's Traveling Libram. The tome contains the following spells: clairvoyance, cloud of daggers, counterspell, detect magic, detect thoughts, find familiar, Melf's acid arrow, Tenser's floating disk, and thunderwave.\nSource: Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden p. 272",

                "description": "Vaelish Gant, Prisoner 237 within the walls of Revel's End, is a member of the Arcane Brotherhood who first engaged in criminal activity by insinuating himself into the trade network of Ten-Towns. He hoped that his work would help the Arcane Brotherhood gain control of the region. A few years ago, shortly after his arrival in Ten-Towns, Gant established a protection racket in Bryn Shander and tried to turn the town against its speaker, Duvessa Shane, with the goal of supplanting her. He also tried to destabilize the economy of Ten-Towns. A party of adventurers thwarted his criminal ventures by capturing him.\nRather than put Gant to death for his crimes in Icewind Dale, the Council of Speakers in Ten-Towns made a deal with representatives of the Lords' Alliance to have Gant serve a life sentence in Revel's End, so as not to incur the Arcane Brotherhood's wrath. The Council of Speakers did this not realizing that Gant's scheme wasn't sanctioned by the Arcane Brotherhood but rather hatched by Gant himself, who intended to impress his superiors by pulling it off.\nFor a long time, Gant held out hope that the Arcane Brotherhood would apply pressure to secure his release, and that the Lords' Alliance would acquiesce to the brotherhood's demands rather than risk an all-out attack on Revel's End. But by now, Gant has been incarcerated long enough to reasonably conclude that no such rescue is forthcoming. His failed scheme was an embarrassment to the Arcane Brotherhood, which has clearly forsaken him.\nVaelish Gant is a mage who specializes in the arcane tradition of abjuration. Pompous and conniving, he never doubts that he's the smartest person in the room, and he makes sure everyone around him knows how he feels.\nGant has neither a spellbook nor material components for spellcasting, and he can't avail himself of his magic while locked in his cell due to the antimagic field that encompasses it.\nSource: Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden p. 160",

                "description": "Vellynne Harpell is a member of the prestigious Harpell family, based in the town of Longsaddle. Cold and dispassionate, she took to magic only a decade ago in her late forties and is skilled in the arcane tradition of necromancy. She has a lifelong struggle\u2014a nervous disorder that manifests as trembling. It can affect her balance and her stride, but she has learned to cast her spells unimpeded by it.\nDespite her firm grasp of the dark arts, she would not have been admitted into the Arcane Brotherhood without her family connections\u2014a fact that sticks in her craw.\nVellynne brought a family heirloom with her to Icewind Dale: a professor orb (see appendix D) that she refers to by its proper name, Professor Skant. This orb has knowledge about Netheril that could be important if Vellynne locates the lost Netherese city buried under the Reghed Glacier. The orb was recently stolen by Nass Lantomir, one of Vellynne's rivals in the Arcane Brotherhood. Vellynne intends to get it back before resuming her quest to find Ythryn.\nCompanions. Since arriving in Icewind Dale, Vellynne has secured the services of six Icewind Kobold that act as her valets and guides. Two of them were killed by a Melf's acid arrow spell (cast by Vellynne's rival, Nass Lantomir), but Vellynne animated their corpses, turning them into zombies.\nIf she is wounded, Vellynne can cast vampiric touch and use the spell to regain hit points at the kobolds' expense.\nFamiliar. Vellynne's familiar is a snowy owl, which the wizard uses as a scout. It uses the owl stat block in the Monster Manual but is a celestial instead of a beast.\nSpellbook. Vellynne's spellbook has black leather covers around pages of ragged parchment, all wrapped in a crimson sash. The necromancer's personal sigil is written in goat's blood on the title page. The tome contains the spells Vellynne has prepared plus the following additional spells: bestow curse, blindness/deafness, false life, find familiar, magic weapon, polymorph, protection from evil and good, remove curse, shield, and Tenser's floating disk.\nSource: Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden p. 273",
