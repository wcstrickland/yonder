While attuned to this weapon, you have disadvantage on attack rolls made with weapons other than this one.\nIn addition, while the sword is on your person, you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw whenever you take damage in combat. On a failed save you must attack the creature that damaged you until you drop to 0 hit points or it does, or until you can't reach the creature to make a melee attack against it.\nYou can break the curse in the usual ways. Alternatively, casting banishment on the sword forces the vengeful spirit to leave it.
