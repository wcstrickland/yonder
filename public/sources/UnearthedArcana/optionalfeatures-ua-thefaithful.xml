    <prerequisite></prerequisite>
    <text>At 3rd level, a character dedicated to the Warlock can select this option instead of one of the warlock's existing Pact Boon options.
The Seeker grants you a chain forged from starlight, decorated with seven gleaming motes of brightness. While the chain is on your person, you know the augury spell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn't count against your number of spells known.
Additionally, you can invoke the Seeker's power to gain advantage on an Intelligence check while you carry this item. Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again until you complete a short or long rest.
If you lose your Star Chain, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from the Seeker. The ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous chain. The chain disappears in a flash of light when you die.
The exact form of this item might be different depending on your patron. The Star Chain is inspired by the Greyhawk deity Celestian.
