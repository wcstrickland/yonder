Warforged (UA Races of Eberron) (Envoy) envoys, however, were designed to perform other functions. As an envoy, you have a skill, a tool proficiency, and a tool that's part of your body. When you make an envoy character, consider the following questions: What is your purpose? How does your skill and your tool reflect that purpose? What form does your integrated tool take? If you have embedded thieves' tools, for instance, are your fingers actually lockpicks, or can you produce keys from various parts of your body? The following characters are examples of Warforged (UA Races of Eberron) (Envoy) with integrated tools.\nLute is a bard with the entertainer background; his namesake instrument folds out of his left arm.\nCompass Rose is a wizard with the outlander background. A keen explorer, she uses her built-in cartographer's tools to record the paths she travels.\nMasque is an infiltrator. A rogue with the charlatan background and an integrated disguise Kit, she was built to blend in and assassinate. Cannith built six Warforged (UA Races of Eberron) (Envoy) of her design, and Masque has vowed to hunt down and destroy the other five.\nIn developing your integrated tool, remember that you must have your hands free to use it. Masque, the infiltrator mentioned above, doesn't shapeshift like a changeling; she has to manually adjust her appearance."
