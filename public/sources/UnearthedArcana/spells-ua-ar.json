Until the spell ends, you deal an extra 1d6 damage of the chosen type to any target you hit with the weapon. If the weapon isn't magical, it becomes a magic weapon for the spell's duration.\nAs a bonus action, you can change the damage type, choosing from the options above.\nAt Higher Levels:\nWhen you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can maintain your concentration on the spell for up to 8 hours.\nSource: Unearthed Arcana: Artificer Revisited p. 10",
