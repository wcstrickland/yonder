When you fall and aren't incapacitated, you can subtract up to 100 feet from the fall when calculating falling damage, and you can move up to 2 feet horizontally for every 1 foot you descend.\n\u2022 Nimble Climber: You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.\n\u2022 Underwater Adaptation: You can breathe air and water, and you have a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.\nAt 5th level, choose one of the following options, or choose one of the options you didn't take at 1st level:\n\u2022 Grappling Appendage: You have two special appendages growing alongside your arms. Choose whether they're both claws or tentacles. Each of these appendages is a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. Immediately after hitting, you can try to grapple the target as a bonus action. These appendages can't precisely manipulate anything and can't wield weapons, magic items, or other specialized equipment.\n\u2022 Carapace: Your skin in places is covered by a thick shell. You gain a +1 bonus to AC when you're not wearing heavy armor.\n\u2022 Acid Spit: As an action, you can spray a stream of acid from glands in your mouth, targeting one creature or object you can see within 30 feet of you. The target takes 2d10 acid damage unless it succeeds on a Dexterity saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus.
