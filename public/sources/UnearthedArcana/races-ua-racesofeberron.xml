        <name>Age</name>
      <text>Changeling (UA Races of Eberron)s mature slightly faster than humans but share a similar lifespanâ€”typically a century or less. While a Changeling (UA Races of Eberron) can shapeshift to conceal their age, the effects of aging still catch up to them.
</text>
      </trait>
    <trait>
        <name>Alignment</name>
      <text>Changeling (UA Races of Eberron)s hate to be bound in any way, and those who follow the path of the Traveler believe that chaos and change are important aspects of life. Most tend toward pragmatic neutrality as opposed to being concerned with lofty ideals. Few Changeling (UA Races of Eberron)s embrace evil.

    <trait>
        <name>Size</name>
      <text>In their natural forms, Changeling (UA Races of Eberron)s average between 5 and 6 feet in height, with a slender build. Your size is Medium.
</text>
      </trait>
    <trait>
        <name>Change Appearance</name>
      <text>As an action, you can transform your appearance or revert to your natural form. You can't duplicate the appearance of a creature you've never seen, and you revert to your natural form if you die.
You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, the sound of your voice, coloration, hair length, sex, and any other distinguishing characteristics. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your game statistics change. You also can't appear as a creature of a different size than you, and your basic shape stays the same; if you're bipedal, you can't use this trait to become quadrupedal, for instance. Your clothing and other equipment don't change in appearance, size, or shape to match your new form, requiring you to keep a few extra outfits on hand to make the most compelling disguise possible.
Even to the most astute observers, your ruse is usually indiscernible. If you rouse suspicion, or if a wary creature suspects something is amiss, you have advantage on any Charisma (Deception) check you make to avoid detection.

Instead, their minds draw from the memories of their otherworldly spirit while they sleep. As such, you are immune to spells and other magical effects that require you to dream, like the dream spell, but not to spells and effects that put you to sleep, like the sleep spell.

        <name>Envoys: Specialized Design</name>
      <text>As the name implies, most Warforged (UA Races of Eberron) (Envoy) were built to fight in the Last War. The vast majority of Warforged (UA Races of Eberron) (Envoy) are juggernauts or skirmishersâ€”soldiers and scouts who fought under the banner of one of the Five Nations. Warforged (UA Races of Eberron) (Envoy) envoys, however, were designed to perform other functions. As an envoy, you have a skill, a tool proficiency, and a tool that's part of your body. When you make an envoy character, consider the following questions: What is your purpose? How does your skill and your tool reflect that purpose? What form does your integrated tool take? If you have embedded thieves' tools, for instance, are your fingers actually lockpicks, or can you produce keys from various parts of your body? The following characters are examples of Warforged (UA Races of Eberron) (Envoy) with integrated tools.
Lute is a bard with the entertainer background; his namesake instrument folds out of his left arm.
Compass Rose is a wizard with the outlander background. A keen explorer, she uses her built-in cartographer's tools to record the paths she travels.
Masque is an infiltrator. A rogue with the charlatan background and an integrated disguise Kit, she was built to blend in and assassinate. Cannith built six Warforged (UA Races of Eberron) (Envoy) of her design, and Masque has vowed to hunt down and destroy the other five.
In developing your integrated tool, remember that you must have your hands free to use it. Masque, the infiltrator mentioned above, doesn't shapeshift like a changeling; she has to manually adjust her appearance.

You can alter your body to enter different defensive modes; each time you finish a long rest, choose one mode to adopt from the Integrated Protection table, provided you meet the mode's prerequisite.
Mode | Prerequisite | Armor Class
Darkwood core (unarmored) | None | 11 + your Dexterity modifier (add proficiency bonus if proficient with light armor)
Composite plating (armor) | Medium armor proficiency | 13 + your Dexterity modifier (maximum of 2) + your proficiency bonus

      <text>Integrated protection
Your body has built-in protective layers, which determine your Armor Class. You gain no benefit from wearing armor, but if you are using a shield, you apply its bonus as normal.
You can alter your body to enter different defensive modes; each time you finish a long rest, choose one mode to adopt from the Integrated Protection table, provided you meet the mode's prerequisite.
Mode | Prerequisite | Armor Class
Darkwood core (unarmored) | None | 11 + your Dexterity modifier (add proficiency bonus if proficient with light armor)
Composite plating (armor) | Medium armor proficiency | 13 + your Dexterity modifier (maximum of 2) + your proficiency bonus
Heavy plating (armor) | Heavy armor proficiency | 16 + your proficiency bonus; disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks
