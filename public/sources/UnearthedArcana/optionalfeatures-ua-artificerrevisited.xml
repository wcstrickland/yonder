      <name>Infusion: Many-Handed Pouch (UA)</name>
    <prerequisite>4th level, 2â€“5 pouches</prerequisite>
    <text>The infused pouches all share one interdimensional space of the same capacity as a single pouch. Thus, reaching into any of the pouches allows access to the same storage space. A pouch operates as long as it is within 100 miles of another one of the pouches; the pouch is otherwise empty and won't accept any contents.
If this infusion ends, the items stored in the shared space move into one of the pouches, determined at random. The rest of the pouches become empty.
