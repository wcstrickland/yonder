You can create the standard bland fare without requiring any sort of check, but you can attempt to create finer food by making a Charisma check; if you're proficient with cook's utensils, add your bonus to this check. A failed check results in a sour and squalid meal.\nFood Quality | Difficulty\nPoor | No roll required\nModest | 10\nComfortable | 13\nWealthy | 15\nAristocratic | 18\nA Bag of Bounty (UA) can be used up to three times over the course of a day.
