As an action, a restrained creature can attempt to free itself or another creature within its reach from the ice, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check. A character freed from the ice is no longer restrained by it. The ice melts in an hour.\nSource: The Lost Dungeon of Rickedness: Big Rick Energy p. 26"
