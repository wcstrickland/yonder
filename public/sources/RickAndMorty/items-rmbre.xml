    <text>A concertina is a less charming kind of accordion.
In addition to knocking out a killer polka, a creature playing the concertina can use an action to cause an area of mist or water up to 30 feet in diameter and 6 inches deep to freeze solid.
Once used, this feature of the concertina can't be used again until the next dawn.
Any creatures touching the floor must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained by the ice. As an action, a restrained creature can attempt to free itself or another creature within its reach from the ice, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check. A character freed from the ice is no longer restrained by it. The ice melts in an hour.
