Just as you are part of the swarm, the swarm is part of a larger ecosystem, a never-ending cycle of life, death, rot, and rebirth. You have spent your life in the slow churn of that ecosystem, in the dark places of the city where the messy parts of existence are on display. There is little squeamishness among the Golgari, no fear of death or taboo about the dead, just a fierce affirmation of the cycle.\n\u2022 Skill Proficiencies: Nature, Survival\n\u2022 Tool Proficiencies: Poisoner's kit\n\u2022 Languages: Choose one of Elvish, Giant, or Kraul\n\u2022 Equipment: A Golgari insignia, a poisoner's kit, a pet beetle or spider, a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp worth of mixed coins\nSource: Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica p. 53"

The swarm relies on you to advance the greater good by protecting some part, however small, of its teeming existence. That responsibility doesn't mean you're indispensable; your eventual death is part of your purpose and function, too, and you'll be replaced even as your body provides nutrients to further the swarm's growth.\nA classic adventuring role for a member of the Golgari involves crawling through dungeon-like environments\u2014the sewers and ancient vaults of the undercity\u2014in search of treasures left behind by the dead. Sometimes you might be sent to find a specific item believed lost in a dangerous part of the undercity. At other times, you could be asked to collect samples of a specific fungus, retrieve a body floating in the muck of the sewers, or bring back whatever booty you can to help fill the swarm's coffers.\nYou might gain enough renown to become a member of the Ochran, assigned to a variety of tasks concerning thievery, assassination, or the protection of important figures in your guild. You might steal something because the guild needs it, or because its loss will bring harm to another guild, hastening that group's decline. You could be assigned to kill an outspoken and active enemy of the Golgari, such as an overzealous Boros captain whose raids into the undercity have approached dangerously close to the swarm's inner sanctum. Or you could serve as a bodyguard to one of Guildmaster Jarad's high chancellors, escorting this figure through the undercity while being ready to intervene at a moment's notice if things go wrong.\nThe shamans of the Golgari use their magic to accelerate the cycle of decay and regrowth. You might be sent to spread spores throughout an area that the Golgari want to claim as their territory or to convince the inhabitants of such a territory to abandon it. You might also contend with the ever-present threat of hostile monsters encroaching into Golgari-controlled regions."

My guild is all that really matters. (Any)\n2 | Change. All life is meant to progress toward perfection, and our work is to hurry it along\u2014no matter what must be upended along the way. (Chaotic)\n3 | Knowledge. Understanding the world is more important than what you do with your knowledge. (Neutral)\n4 | Greater Good. I want to reshape the world into higher forms of life so that all can enjoy evolution. (Good)\n5 | Logic. It's foolish to let emotions and principles interfere with the conclusions of logic. (Lawful)\n6 | Superiority. My vast intellect and strength are directed toward increasing my sway over others. (Evil)\n\nBonds\nd6 | Bond\n1 | I helped create a krasis that I love like a pet and would carry with me everywhere... except it's the size of a building, and it might eat me.\n2 | In my laboratory, I discovered something that I think could eliminate half the life on Ravnica.\n3 | The other researchers in my clade are my family\u2014a big, eccentric family including members and parts of many species.\n4 | The laboratory where I did my research contains everything that is precious to me.\n5 | I will get revenge on the shortsighted fool who killed my precious krasis creation.\n6 | Everything I do is an attempt to impress someone I love.\n\nFlaws\nd6 | Flaw\n1 | I have a rather embarrassing mutation that I do everything I can to keep hidden.\n2 | I'm more interested in taking notes on monstrous anatomy than in fighting monsters.\n3 | Every social situation I'm in seems to lead to my asking rude personal questions.\n4 | I'm supremely confident in my ability to adapt to any situation and handle any danger.\n5 | I'll take any risk to earn recognition for my scientific brilliance.\n6 | I have a tendency to take shortcuts in my research and any other tasks I have to complete."
