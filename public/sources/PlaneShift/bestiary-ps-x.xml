The song ends if the Harpy–Plane Shift: Ixalan is incapacitated.</text>
      <text>While charmed by the Harpy–Plane Shift: Ixalan, a target is incapacitated and ignores the songs of other harpies. If the charmed target is more than 5 feet away from the Harpy–Plane Shift: Ixalan, the target must move on its turn toward the Harpy–Plane Shift: Ixalan by the most direct route. It doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the Harpy–Plane Shift: Ixalan, a target can repeat the saving throw. A creature can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it.</text>
      <text>A target that successfully saves is immune to this Harpy–Plane Shift: Ixalan's song for the next 24 hours.</text>

    <trait>
        <name>Death Throes</name>
      <text>When the sunbird dies, it explodes, and each creature within 30 feet of it must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 42 (12d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The explosion ignites flammable objects in that area that aren't being worn or carried. The sunbird's body turns to ash, but an egg is left where the sunbird was.</text>

    <trait>
        <name>Fire Aura</name>
      <text>At the start of each of the sunbird's turns, each creature within 5 feet of it takes 11 (2d10) fire damage, and flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried ignite. A creature that touches the sunbird or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 11 (2d10) fire damage. The aura also sheds bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light for an additional 60 feet.</text>

A grappled creature takes 11 (2d10) fire damage at the start of each of the sunbird's turns.</text>
